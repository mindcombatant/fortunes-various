makefile is based on https://github.com/JKirchartz/fortunes/blob/master/Makefile with some added tweaks to make it do what i want, also, i really don't understand makefiles (yet) so it's probably got some bad practices in it, feel free to use it or not. ```make``` and ```sudo make install``` should set up all files in the directory as fortunes on your system, maybe.
