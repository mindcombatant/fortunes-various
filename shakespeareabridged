Hey Hot Guy, have a kid or two,
So hotness doesn't die with you.
%
2
Eyes get sunken, skin gets loose.
Before you're old, man, reproduce.
%
3
Your conduct's got your mom dismayed.
Be a good boy — plow some maid.
%
4
If looks are cash, you're over-pledged.
So breed, to get your hotness hedged.
%
5 & 6
You're like a flower: crap, come Winter.
So, while it's summer, have a litter.

If you have ten, and they have ten,
We'll have a hundred sexy men.
%
7
The sun grows dull as days wear on.
Just like your face. So, have a son.
%
8
Wife and child and you: that's tone.
Don't just pluck your string alone.
%
9
If you should die, we're beauty's widows.
You heartless bastard, have some kiddos.
%
10
You hate us all, or so I gather.
You beauty-wasting baby-not-haver.
%
11
While we're waning, kids are ramping.
You're Nature's stamp, so get to stamping!
%
12
Plants get dead like you'll get dead.
Preserve your beauty — get it bred.
%
13
You're leasing hotness, you don't own it.
Make a son. And hotness? Loan it.
%
14
I see your future, through your eyes:
"One day, this kidless hot guy dies."
%
15 & 16
Time will sully then degrade you.
Unlike this sonnet, which I made you.

But poems cannot sate my need
To see you give some maid your seed.
%
17
Have kids, so that I shan't be slandered:
"Promoted Unreal Beauty Standard."
%
18
Summer's bad, then dies. You won't.
(Okay, you will, but poems don't.)
%
19
Time! Do your worst to my love's face!
I care not. This sonnet's ​ace.
%
20
You're like a sexy woman, guy.
Too bad I'm not (the least bit!) bi.
%
21
Another poet's too artistic.
He calls you "gem!" ​I'm​realistic.
%
22
You have my heart and I've got yours.
Let's tend our cardiovasculatures.
%
23
No words have I, when you I gawk.
Consider silence pretty-talk.
%
24
My body stores my tablet heart.
My eyes are painters, bad at art.
%
25
So long as our loves overlap,
No one can make me feel like crap.
%
26
A better rhyme I'll one day knit
For you my love (but this ain't it.)
%
27 & 28
Can't sleep by day, ‘cause work's my duty.
Can't sleep by night, ‘cause you're a cutie.

How can I keep a mind that's seemly,
When Night and Day thus double-team me?
%
29
When in disgrace and feeling crappy,
I think "you love me." Then I'm happy.
%
30
Unless upon you I'm reflecting,
I weep whenever introspecting.
%
31
They're dead to me, who wouldn't have me.
You're like those loves, but not cadavery.
%
32
If you should read these when I'm buried,
Say "Sentiment: lovely. Quality: varied."
%
33
My Sun, the clouds corrupt your shine.
You hurt me, ‘kay? Whatever. ​Fine.
%
34
Your "sorry" shan't my shame allay.
It's fine. I'm fine. Just fine, okay?
%
35
Oh, don't be sad, love, be guilt-free.
Sorry I let you be awful to me.
%
36
So... turns out I'm the guilty party.
We aren't on speaking terms now (are we?).
%
37
I am garbage, you are great,
And that's what keeps me going, mate.
%
38
It takes no skill to write of thee.
A harder subject: horrid me.
%
39
We're one, so praising you's immodest.
Let's split, so I can call you hottest.
%
40
You stole my girl! Was that a way
To flirt with me? If so, okay.
%
41
When next my girl desires your bed.
How ‘bout someone else instead?
%
42
We're ​one. ​By transitivity:
When she does you, she's doing me.
%
43
No need to see you, man. It's fine.
I'll watch you nightly, in my mind.
%
44 & 45
If airy thought, I'd fly to thee.
Instead, I just cry quietly.

My fire, my air — ‘til they revert
From you, I'm just some soggy dirt.
%
46
My eyes and heart claimed rights to thee,
Then settled for split custody.
%
47
When eye or heart must get their fix,
My heart shares thoughts, my eyes send pics.
%
48
Each favorite thing of mine I fetter.
If you were thus, I'd feel much better.
%
49
You'll leave because I'm awful, love.
I write to tell you: "fair enough."
%
50 & 51
I leave you, weighed with such remorse,
It really sucks to be my horse.

I come back, spurring, wanting speed.
It really sucks to be my steed.
%
52
Scarceness gives things greater piquancy.
So THANKS for coming so infrequently
%
53
All sexy art is you in part,
You've many forms, but constant heart.
%
54
Though roses die, their smells ne'er do.
My rose, this poem smells like you.
%
55
War and death and slutty time
Will waste all things except this rhyme.
%
56
This time apart shall help renewing
Your grasp that love is more than screwing.
%
57 & 58
I LOVE to slave and serve for you.
It's not like I had things to do.

I needn't hear where you embark.
It's GREAT here, crying in the dark.
%
59
Is Shakespeare's rhyming hist'ry's best?
Or's his muse just good-lookiest?
%
60
Time will kill you, lacking pity.
Unlike this verse that says you're pretty.
%
61
D'you send your ghost to haunt my rest?
No? Perhaps I'm just obsessed.
%
62
I love myself, till mirr'r reflects me.
But we are one, so still, I'm sexy.
%
63
My love, your face gets worse and worse.
At least it's young within this verse.
%
64
Decay and change and death do happen.
One day too, our love shall crappen.
%
65
Against cruel time, frail beauty's savior
Is me. The poet, William Shakespeare.
%
66
Beauty's junked and virtue's boned.
I'd die, but then you'd be aloned.
%
67
Why'd Nature place you ‘midst the skanky?
So She could say, " ‘Twas once less stanky."
%
68
The skanky need to ornament
Themselves, but you were born with it.
%
69
If people say "he's scum, though hot."
Just thank the scumbag friends you've got.
%
70
By wicked tongues, you've been profaned,
But pure and perfect, you've remained.
%
71 & 72
Think not of me once I'm worm-foody.
I'd hate my corpse to make you moody.

If asked about that Shakespeare chap,
Speak not, for I was total crap.
%
73 & 74
I'm dying soon, I'm pretty sure.
Which fact should strengthen our ​amour.​

But, when I'm dead, do not regret.
My rhymes were good. My body? Ech.
%
75
Like glutton's food, like miser's money
I get you lots, but want more, honey.
%
76
You say my verse repeats a ton.
You know what else repeats? ​The sun.
%
77
Write your mem'ries here, to peek
Your sexy past, once you're antique.
%
78
Now other poets are obsessed
With you. It sucks. Please like me best.
%
79
He "finds" your hotness. That's his claim.
I ​see​ your hotness. Not the same!
%
80
If you're the sea, my ship is callow.
He sails your deep, I bark your shallow.
%
81
When I am dirt, I'll be forgotten.
You'll live within my verse once rotten.
%
82
That poet gilds when gold's undue.
That's fine for uggos, not for you!
%
83
No verse could e'er encapsulate thee.
And thus, I've not been writing lately.
%
84
You're hot. No poet ought embellish it.
But poets do because you relish it.
%
85
Your poet friends are great. I'm not.
But, I like you a lot. A LOT.
%
86
His rhymes ne'er caused my pen to fail!
I'm silent due to ​your betrayal!
%
87
My worth is naught. Your worth immense.
This breakup thus makes total sense.
%
88 & 89 & 90
When scornful lies on me you state,
I'm on your side, man. HA! CHECKMATE.

Insult me, love. I'll not debate thee.
I hate your hates, so let's both hate me!

Oh, dump me now, so now's unhappiness
Shall dwarf all later living's crappiness.
%
91 & 92 & 93
I'm ugly, poor, my writing's trite.
But I've your love. I do. Right?

Without your love, my heart stops beating.
I live. You love me. Wait... you cheating?

I tell myself you're ne'er untrue,
For cheating's something uggoes do.
%
94
Noble hotties are flow'rs among us.
But better weed than flower with fungus.
%
95
When housed in you, jerkassery
Takes on the form of classery.
%
96
Your sexy looks lead men to shame,
And since you're mine, I get the blame!
%
97
Summer's flowers, Autumn's fruitage:
It's all just Winter sans your cute-age.
%
98 & 99
Your absence did my springtime screw
Each flower was a lesser you.

I screamed "HEY FLOW'RS! I SEE YOUR PLAN!"
YOU STOLE YOUR BEAUTIES FROM MY MAN!"
%
100 & 101
Muse! Gimme verse that aggrandizes
My lover ere he ugly-tizes.

Oh muse, I know he needs no frill.
But, once a corpse, he prob'ly will.
%
102
Restrictions on my verse supply
Were made to keep their value high.
%
103
Than verse, your looks are always dearer.
If I've not written, check your mirror.
%
104
To me you're young as when we met!
(Though possibly I'm incorrect.)
%
105
My love is not idolatry!
It's just... you're rather God-ish, see?
%
106
The ancients lacked you, but wrote your beauty.
Today we have you, but write not-goodly.
%
107
You got jailed. The world's chaotic.
We'll live on here once we're necrotic!
%
108
I'm out of ways to call you fabulous.
Our love's grown old, yet not cadaverous!
%
109
I've been away, but ne'er in heart!
I'm junk. You're great. So why depart?
%
110
I've cheated. Dallied. Lived in sin.
I miss you, can we date again?
%
111 & 112
I'm acting now. And publicly.
No cure is known, but pity me.

Though I'm debauched by vulgar tongue,
Your love is all my Right or Wrong.
%
113 & 114
All's your face since our adieu.
Uggos, hotties, birds — all you!

Am I nuts, or's your face ubiquitous?
(The first idea seems less ridiculous.)
%
115
I thought our love had peaked, but facts
Have proved that peak a local max.
%
116
Time can't wither love. If't can
Then screw my love and poems, man.
%
117
Ignoring, slighting, bein' untrue
Was just my way of testing you.
%
118 & 119
Just as poison fights disease
I cheated to our love increase.

You look so fine since my bad-doin's
Let's build new love on old love's ruins.
%
120
You know how I know you hate my deceivin'?
You cheated too. And now we're even.
%
121
Than bad-reputed, being bad's more fun.
They call me bad? ​Takes one to know one.
%
122
A notebook. Thanks. This poem's to say
My memory's fine, so I gave it away.
%
123
Ignore the old, despise the new!
Time can't change me! I'll stay true.
%
124
My love's not thralled to its conditions.
It's not like flowers or politicians.
%
125
Fine stuff's not what love's about.
Let's keep love simple. OUT, SPY! OUT!
%
126
Only you, love, make time tarry.
That's temporary. (    )
%
127
Since makeup means no beauty's honest,
I like your darkness and your blah-ness.
%
128
The keyboard gets your fingertips.
I'm jealous. Can I have the lips?
%
129
I'm savage, murd'rous, very odd.
Outside my refract'ry period.
%
130
My girl has little sex appeal.
But has this virtue: she is real.
%
131
They call you ugly. I've disagreed.
It's not so much your looks as deeds.
%
132
Your lovely eyes are black to mourn me
And how remain I super-horny.
%
133 & 134
Your heart imprisons me and he.
Jail me darling, set him free!

I asked him you my worth to tell.
And now you're dating? What the hell?!
%
135 & 136
I'm Will, my Willy Willys swell.
Will you my Willy Will as well?

My Willy words weren't Willy nilly.
You're Willy wild! Will Willy's Willy!
%
137
My eyes saw fair where foul is found.
My heart said "pure!" though you sleep ‘round.
%
138
I call her hot, she calls me young.
We each believe the other's tongue.
%
139
Your glances kill. ‘Sthat why your eyes
More often look at other guys?
%
140
Lie and say that we're an us
Or be badmouthed to the credulous!
%
141
You're ugly. Shrill. You're coarse. You smell.
And yet, I love and serve you. Hell.
%
142
Reproach me not for loving thee.
You've cheated lots, please cheat with me!
%
143
A baby, mom, and fleeing chicken.
She'll chase the bird, while babe lies stricken.
%
144
My girl, my guy. I think she humps 'im.
But shan't find out until she dumps 'im.
%
145
She said "I hate," but she
Thank God did not mean me!
%
146
Poor soul of mine, to have to toil
Inside my crappy mortal coil.
%
147
Reason's my doctor, love's my ague
The doc has left, so... can I bang you?
%
148
I see not ugly, seeing you.
I guess my tears obscure my view?
%
149
I love you not? Then tell me why
I hate your hates, including I?
%
150
I love you though you're mean and gross!
How come you don't love me the most?
%
151
Your slave, I rise and fall for thee.
(I mean those words suggestively).
%
152
I cheated once. You cheated twice.
But I'm more false: I've called you nice.
%
153 & 154
As Cupid slept, nymphs quenched his torch
In water, which began to scorch.

A bath to cure lust and VD!
I tried. It didn't work for me.
%
