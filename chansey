Can you say what day of the week it is?

It's easy to learn a lot about something you like.

If you burp, just say, "Sorry." That'll make it okay!
%
Look in a mirror and shout out loud,  "Go for it!"
%
It's perfectly okay to brag once in a while.
%
Aren't you a little bit too close to the television?

It takes no effort to pollute the seas and mountains, but cleaning them up does.

Right this instant you are staring at the television screen. (I'm right, right?)

If you like something as a child, you will remember it at times when you grow older.

If you're upset with yourself, it could be an opportunity for you to grow as a person.
%
Do you know about "Piccola Chara Roolay"? There's no such thing!

It looks like it could be a real burden, but everyone wants to be adored.
%
I bet you're good at Smeargle Paint, aren't you?
%
(I couldn't think of anything. Sorry...)

If you obey the rules, the rules will protect you.
%
If you're acting angry and pouty, doesn't it make you tired?
%
Do you get told to take a bath often?

Even if you're not good at many things, if you're good at one thing, isn't it enough?

If you have worries on your mind, eat them up with your snack!
%
Here's a secret: you're the star.
%
Could it be... Love?

There has never been anyone who never fails.
%
Dreams love effort.
%
It is good to be loved, but it's also important for you to love.
%
Whoa! Wobbuffet!
%
If everyone were all the same, how would I know if it was you?
