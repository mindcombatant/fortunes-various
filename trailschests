AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Aaaaah! Yeah, clip that grass into me.
...What? The last time you opened me,
it sort of awoke something.
%
Abandon all hope, ye who open me.

A bracer, an Erebonian, and a member of the CPD walk into a bar.
Shortly thereafter, they'rsic each admitted to St. Ursula with mild
concussions.
%
A bracer assaulting a chest, I can understand.
But a cop? That's low, man.

A bracer robbing a chest, I can understand.
But a cop? That's low, man.

A cascade of freshly-hatched spiders pours from the chest.
%
ACERBIC TOMATOES ARE PEOPLE

A chest, a chest! My kingdom for a chest!
%
A closer inspection of the chest reveals an inscription that says 'For Doodles.'
Wow, this really is the inside of KeA's heart.
%
A cube has six faces, but none of them look as
disappointed as yours does right now.
%
A forgotten chest
Despoiled and left behind
Its sad lot in life
%
After cleaning the inside, you decide to polish the outside as well.
%
After minutes of frantic searching, you close
the lid, panting heavily. It's time to admit you
have a problem.
%
After reexamining the chest, you find something else...
IT'S THE BUG OF LEGENDS!
%
After that string of chest thefts in Liberl, you
would think they'd have some locks installed.
%
A hand holding an orbal gun
peeks out from inside the chest.
'The Elder King sends his regards.'
%
Ah HA! I'm actually an undercover chest
working for the Chest Police Department.
You're busted, buster!
%
Ah-ha! You again!
%
AHH! Goddess, it hurts! The grass
is clipping right through me!
%
AHHH! Goddess, it hurts! The grass

Ahh! I can finally breathe, now that I don't
have that deviated septium anymore.
%
Ahh, I get it. Fish prints.
Of course. Fish prints.
%
Aidios will remember that.
%
All kidding aside, we really do
believe in you. You got this!
%
All of this chest's worldly possessions now
reside within your pack. Unless you sold
them. You didn't SELL them, did you?
%
All that's left at the bottom is the tiny glimmer of hope.
%
All the items here are pretty amazing, aren't they? Use them well.
%
Alzheimer's much?
%
A message is engraved in the chest: 'Hngh... Lechter.
I'm trying to mess with Crossbell's politics, but I'm
dummy thicc, and the sound of my blood-and-iron
rule keeps alerting the mayor.'
%
Am I the only who thinks the name 'Bellguard'
is just a little on the nose?
%
Amongst chests, it's not what's on the inside
that counts, but what's on the outside.
%
An advertisement is pasted to the bottom side of the lid:
You'd have to be BLIND to not see all Maison Imelda has to offer!
For availabilities, contact Madam Imelda at Imelda's Antiques.
%
And I thought letting you rob me would have been enough to get rid of
you...
%
An empty chest is a tragic thing indeed.
%
An empty chest! Scandalous!
%
An empty coffer
Devoid of any treasure.
Go seek another.

An empty treasure chest. Full of promise
yet devoid of payoff. A perfect metaphor for me.
%
An evil, unassuming-looking, middle-aged
scholar? In MY Trails game?!
...It's more likely than you think.
%
Annie's not okay. She wants you to
Arrest the Smooth Criminal.
%
Annoyed at having to check every treasure chest twice?
You should treasure these chest messages while you can.
After all, one day, they might not be there anymore...
%
A note inside of the treasure chest reads:
'I already have 99, so you guys take this one.
- Estelle'

An unassuming-looking, middle-aged scholar
who turns out to be evil? In MY Trails game?!

Any chance you could put that back where

Any reference to that other big Falcom
series would be a great Yster Egg.

Arc en Ciel tried to recruit me as a stage prop,
but I hate being boxed into only one kind of role.

Are you back because you thought I was booty-full?
Congratulations! After a game and a half of being a police

I guess you can stop playing now.

A single tumbleweed rolls from one side of the
chest to another.
%
A small plate of windowglass lies on the bottom of the empty box. Alas,
another unexpected chest pane!
%
A small spider skitters from one side of the empty
chest to the other. It's actually kind of cute...
%
As payment for taking my stuff, you must cut down
the tallest tree in the forest...with...A HERRING!
%
A spider looks at you angrily for disturbing its living room.
%
As you approach, the chest bursts open on its
own! Unfortunately, there's nothing inside.
%
As you close the chest, it gives you a sad look.
It wishes it had something more for you, too.
%
As you close the empty chest, you weigh the
pluses and minuses of staying in there to jump
out scare the next person who checks it.
%
As you close the lid on yet another empty
treasure chest, you wonder if the locks are only
decorative.
%
As you crack the lid of the chest, you hear a
sound like the collective wailing of editors. You
let the lid drop, sealing the sound away forever.
%
As you gaze at the empty chest, you convince yourself
that your friends are the only treasure you'll ever need.
%
As you look in the chest, a bright light goes off.
'AHA! I've got photographic proof! I'm taking this
straight to the Crossbell News Service!'
...You quickly close the lid and leave.
%
As you look into the darkness of the empty
chest, it reminds you of the darkness that fills
your heart.
%
As you look into the woodgrain of the empty
chest, you wonder how many chests could be
made out of a single tree.
%
As you looted the penguin from the chest, you could
have sworn it whispered something about a man it
calls 'Monsieur' and the importance of daily exercise.
%
As you open the box again, you think about what
it would be like if you live inside it like a little
house. It'd be cramped, but quaint.
%
As you open the chest, a number of trapped,
screaming souls come swirling out.
...That's probably normal.
%
As you open the empty chest, it creaks loudly,
probably cursing you out in its native tongue.
%
As you open the treasure chest, you realize that
coming back for more is probably selfish.
You decide to leave what remains to other.

%
As you open this already-empty chest,
its hinges pinch you in revenge.
%
As you peer inside, you're assaulted by an unholy cacophony of
voices, shrilly shouting at you. Making demands, repeating your
failures, questioning your worth.
Knowing you've only ever given your best effort, you ignore them.
%
As you reach into the chest, the lid suddenly
snaps down! IT'S EATING YOU ALIVE. ...Kidding!
Oh, you should've seen the look on your face!
%
As you search the empty chest's insides,
just in case you missed something last time,
it gives you a splinter.
%
As you try to open the empty chest, you break
part of the corner off. Hoping nobody notices,
you put the piece down and briskly walk away..
%
As you turn away from the empty chest, you hear
a strange and ominous hissing.
%
As you walk away with a mediocre item, you fail to notice
that the chest itself is made of priceless Zemurian Ore.

At least buy me dinner first!

A treasure chest walked into a bar.
As it was clearly a mimic, it was instantly slaughtered.
Poor thing didn't even get a drink...

Obviously it was a mimic and immediately slaughtered.

Attached to the balm is a label that reads 'Best before: S1005.'
Perhaps you shouldn't use this one...
%
Attempting luck skill check...
Luck skill check failed.
The chest is still empty.
%
At the bottom of the chest you find only crumbs.
Briefly wondering how long a chest like this
would keep food fresh for, you walk away.
%
At this point, you need to think outside the box.
%
Awesome! Let's chest bump!
%
Aw, man! Nothing AGAIN? Geez.
%
Aww. I had an extra item in here, but you just missed it!
%
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me. ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you... ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ

Back again, are we?
%
Back again? You might be the most desperate
hero I've ever met.
%
Back for more, eh?
Some people are never satisfied...
%
Back for more items? What am I, a shop?
%
Back for seconds? Have you even used what you
got the first time?

Back in my day, we had to work HARD for our
curia balms. And we definitely wouldn't have 99
of them in our second playthrough. No, siree.

BREAKING NEWS! There is nothing in this chest.
More at eleven.

But FIRST, a word from our sponsors: Orbal VPN!

But I would walk 500 selge ‚ô™
And I would walk 500 more ‚ô™
Just to be the chest who walked 1,000 selge ‚ô™
To fall down at your door ‚ô™

...But the real treasure is KNOWLEDGE.
%
Bye-bye. I'll miss you.
%
By looking inside this chest again, you flunk! ...Just kidding.
%
By the way, where did you find the key to open me?
%
Can I help you?
Oh, wait. YOU ALREADY HELPED YOURSELF.
%
Can't even sleep in peace...
%
Can you close my lid? I don't want a bird to
build a nest inside me or something.
%
Can you feel how hard this chest is?
I could bench press your entire party.
%
Can you tell this treasure was outsourced?
%
Check as many times as you want. Nothing will
ever be in here again.
%
Check me once, shame on you.
Check me twice, still shame on you.
Please stop checking me.

Chest contains nothing,
but you can't carry any more, so you left it there.

Chest fact: Chests have domed lids to discourage being
sat on and repel water from pooling atop it. Doing so
extends the lifespan of the chest!

Did you know? Early concepts had Joshua as the protagonist while Estelle

more sense if the roles were switched.
%
Did you know? Ein's name was originally translated as 'Anne' in the novel
Carnelia, but this name dropped the meaning to her name, which is 'One'
in German. That's why it's respectfully back to 'Ein' now.

Did you know? Fifty percent of the time,

Did you know if you join the Business Owners'
Association and start hiding items inside of chests,
they double over time? It's called Mors' law.

Did you know? It's true that Zin's name was once written as 'Zane', but
another name change considered was Olivier's. The original suggestion
was 'Oliver'. This chest is glad that request never went through.

Did you know that this treasure chest is an
S-rank bracer? Yes, treasure chests have their
own Bracer Guild. And this chest is legendary.

feature on PC. That's not even in the original Japanese version! Isn't that
neato torpedo?

Did you know? Trails in the Sky's Japanese name is 'Sora no Kiseki,'
but the Japanese team has fully endorsed the English name to the point
where it's used on the cover of the Sora no Kiseki manga in Japan!

Did you know? Trails in the Sky takes place in Liberl, but there are other
Trails games that take place beyond the kingdom's borders. For example,
Trails of Cold Steel happens in the Erebonian Empire (buy it).

you reading me on Trails in the Database?

Disappointed by the lack of treasure, you briefly

Eleven months ago, the SSS gained its foremost rival

Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the chest.

Every chest message is a faithful translation.

Every chest you open gets Ouroboros one step
closer to obtaining the Sept-Terrion of Chests.

Every time you take something that's not yours

Have you seen those chests from Erebonia? They're the strong, silent type.
%
Heaven saw that, you know.
%
Heh. I'm giving you that for free 'cause I know
before long, you'll come crawlin' back for more.
%
Hello, darkness, my old friend...
I've come to be looted again...
%
Hello, lads! I'm President Locksmith, and it's a pleasure
to meet you. I'd like to award you medals for opening all
of my friends earlier this year during the bolt incident.
%
Help! I'm careening off of a cliff!
I think my S-Brakes were cut!
%
Help us! Our tunnel has been occupied by the Red Chestellation--
the strongest jaeger corps in all of chestern Zemuria!
%
Here's a crossbow for a CROSS BRO... Ahahaha... I don't actually have a
crossbow for you, Father. Sorry.
%
Hey again. Wait. Where's that guy you were with before?
%
Hey, do you know a doctor? I am feeling a deep pain in my chest.
Oh, wait. I AM a chest!
%
Hey, Father! I have some new Stregas inside. Would you kindly come in
and try them on?
%
Hey, I know you had high hopes for this chest,
but it's empty. Don't worry about it, though!
Maybe the next one will have something great.
%
Hey! I stole this first!
%
Hey! My eyes are up here.
%
Hey! Nice to see you again!
%
Hey! No Lloydering.
%
Hey, now that you're in the final stretch, you don't
need to hoard all your rare consumables anymore.
...Right?
%
Hey, there's an echo in here! ...Echo in here... ...Echo in here... ...in here...
%
Hey! You're stickin' your Gnosis in places they don't belong.
%
Hey! Your Gnosis sticking in places it doesn't belong.
%
Hey, you. Yeah, you. Stop reading all these chest
messages and get on with playing the game!
%
H-How did you see me?
%
High five! Down low! ...Oh, no! I don't have hands!
%
Hi, I'm Chest McClure. You may remember me
from such Falcom games as...
%
H-l- m-! I wand-r-d into th- light and this
ha---n-d. May I -l-as- borrow an -- Charg-?
%
Hold me, Noey ‚ô™ Hold me, Noey ‚ô™
I ain't got nothing but love, babe ‚ô™
Eight days a Seek ‚ô™
%
Holy crap!
Is that a motherhecking
GAGHARV reference???
%
Hopefully, that will help you overcome
the last handful of barriers in your way.
%
Hoping against hope the chest will be full of
goodies again, you slowly raise the lid. Nope.
%
How about you do your job and actually arrest someone
for once? Yourselves, in this case.

How can Estelle spin her staff so fast?
Because it's a hurry-cane!
%
How Can Miras Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real
%
How did Clarice Seeker decide her eldest daughter's name?
She wanted to raise a girl who could take no L's.
%
How did I land a job inside the Azure Tree?
Let's just say the hire elements were active.
%
How do I deal with having my treasures stolen?
Stiff upper lid, my boy. Stiff upper lid.
%
How'd you even get here? Don't you
have anything better to do?
%
How many chests could a chest checker check if a chest checker could
check chests?
%
How many years does it take for a story of heroes
to become a legend of heroes, anyway?
%
How many years has this treasure chest been
here? How many adventurers has this chest seen?
You aren't the first, and you won't be the last.
%
How nice of you to play again!
...You DID use your own file, didn't you?
%
How often do you think Remiferian general
goods stores get phone calls asking if they
have Prince Albert in a can?
%
How would you like it if some random chest
kept opening you?
%
Huh...? Uh, you want a chest message...?
Um, just a sec... In the middle of a Pom Party
match right now...
%
Hurry and finish writing me! It's almost midnight on New Year's Eve,
and the Geofront is about to close chest message subm--
%
'Hyeh hyeh hyeh!'
(Imelda appears to have left a voice recorder in the chest.)
%
I actually have an even better treasure in me. The two
who sold it to me said it was invisible to incompetent
people, and clearly they were telling the truth.
%
I also received the gift of the Sept-Terrion.
There was a second item, but I used spatial
annihilation to keep you from getting it.
%
I always dreamed of being plundered by the pirate Schirmer.
...Why did I have to be put in a mine in a landlocked state?
%
I always wanted to be a fisherman
but, well... *sob*
%
I AM COMING FOR YOU.
%
I am content without my contents.
%
I AM ERROR
%
I am the renowned chest specialist, Dr. Trey Shure, PhD.
Thank you for saving me from those hooligans.
%
I AM WATCHING YOU.
%
I applied for a domain on the orbal network,
not to MOVE to a Domain. Stupid Crossbell
bureaucracy mix-ups.
%
I came here from Liberl to hide from a
bracer couple that kept looting my fri--
YOU TWO!
%
I can trace my lineage back to my ancient anchestors.
%
I challenged Father Kevin to an arm wrestling
contest, but he easily won. He must have the
strength of a Thousand Arms.
%
I CLAPPED! I CLAPPED WHEN HE USED
THE EIGHT LEAVES ONE BLADE STYLE!
%
I come from a long line of paper, plastic, and glass assassins.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, SSS...
I am known as Bin.
%
%
I'd ask yourself how long that Potluck has
been in this chest and if you feel lucky.
%
I'd been training for so long to be a dresser,
but I was railroaded into being yet another
treasure chest.
%
I'd have a witty message, but our lead
editor was too busy playing FFXIV.
%
I did my job as a chest. Now you do yours.
%
I did my job. Now you do yours.
%
I'd love to Cast 1, too, but the
fishing spot is way over there!
%
I don't see your name on that item, so why are you taking it?
%
I don't think there's an "open every chest in
the game" trophy, but even if there were,
you've already opened this one.
%
I don't understand these new master quartz battle orbments.
They're nothing but an Enigma to me.
%
I'd put a joke about law enforcement here,
but it'd be a bit of a cop-out.
%
I dunno. Seems to me like Eight Blades One Leaf
would be more impressive.
%
I dunno what you expected...
%
I expected nothing, and I'm still disappointed.
%
If a chest is looted in the forest, does it make a sound?
%
If a cluttered chest is a sign of a cluttered
mind, then what's an empty chest a sign of?
A no-good thief!
%
If a music group were to perform in this tower,
would that make them an Orchistra?
%
If a treasure chest is opened in a forest and there's no adventurer there
to check it, is it still empty?
%
If doing the right thing was easy, it wouldn't be heroic.
If heroes were common, they wouldn't write legends
about them.
%
I feel blessed to have gotten the chance to work on this series. I feel like
it was a lot of luck to get this chance. -- 'S'
%
%
I feel so empty...
%
If I catch you using debug again,
I'm gonna whoop your de-butt.
%
If I didn't want to be opened, I would have taken a job as a coffin.
%
If I were a trader, how much would my Hay be Worth?
Do you think I could Renne a business off of it?
%
If Lloyd ends up adopting KeA,
does that make him a dadtective?
%
If monsters like to eat sepith and I was full
of sepith...does that make me a...? Oh, no...
%
If my wish come true, I want to become a bird.
Even if I lose everything else, someday I want
to go to the place of memories with him.
%
If only all Trails fans would stock up on Battle Scopes.
Then they could finally stop arguing about power levels.
%
If only I'd come with an explosive trap...
%
If that's Stargazer's Tower, does this
make me Towergazer's Chest?
%
If the CPD found out who stole from me,
you'd be unempLloyd.
%
If things seem too difficult and you feel like giving up, take a quick break
and then keep going. You've already made it this far, right?
%
If this ain't a chest message,
then I don't know what is.
%
If this chest could talk, it would say, 'You took my
stuff already.'
%
If this empty chest were filled to the brim with food, it still wouldn't be
enough to satisfy Ries.
%
If this place has been deserted since before the Orbal Revolution,
how did I have a quartz inside me? Chew on that one...
%
If this was your first playthrough and you were
expecting to get the treasure chest achievement
just now...yeah. That's only possible in NG+. Sorry.
%
If Trails to Azure is so good, where is Trails to Bzure?
%
If you can read this...well.
%
If you get any more handsy, I'm going to
have to do your job for you and take you
in myself!
%
If you grind your teeth in an RPG,
do they get stronger?
%
If you keep checking every chest in this tower,
we're going to start calling your team the
Stallritter.
%
If you read this, the clowns have won.
%
If you're 'down' with the 'sickness,' then
maybe you should get yourself checked-in
to St. Ursula Medical College.
%
If you're going to take all that out, the least you could do is take care of
the dust, too.
%
If you're looking for self-help books, there's one
I recommend called 'Getting Over Barriers'.
It's located in the special support section.

%
If you stare into this chest and say 'Ouroboros' five times, Blueblanc will
visit you this night.
%
If you think about it, a chest is just a
barrier between you and what's inside.
And since when have you let those stop you?
%
If you think about it, a chest is just a
barrier between you and what's inside.
Not like that's stopping you!
%
If you think you're feeling betrayed now,
just wait until you find out how many
dinosaurs are in Dinosaur.
%
If you want it that badly, you could've asked.
%
If you want something else, you're going to have
to sign this legally-binding contract.
%
If you were looking for gold, you'll find not one Graham.
%
I gave you everything I had to give, and yet...
%
I get the feeling we've already met... Say, you got a twin by any chance?
%
I guess chests weren't important enough to invite to the
trade conference, huh, Dieter? Fine. We'll be holding our
own Chest Zemuria Trade Conference.
%
I guess you could say that you have all the elements
of a hero in the making. Go get 'em.
%
I guess you could say the contents of this
chest add up to...zero.
%
I had a heart of gold until you STOLE it.
%
I had hoped that Phantom Thief B would be the one to
loot me. I guess I'm not beautiful enough. *whimper*
%
I had saved some coffee for you, but then it was
taken in a mugging.
%
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but
I think my friends and I will be the only
Calvardian chests you ever meet that talk.
%
I hate to tell you this, but you've already cleaned
this one out.
%
I have a cousin back in Liberl. Just sent me a letter complaining
that some famous chest-robbers are on the loose again, and
they even have a new member in their ranks!
%
I have a cousin in Erebonia. He doesn't talk much.
%
I have a sinking feeling in my chest.
%
I have a somewhat unfavorable premonition about this.
%
I HAVE FOUND YOU.
TURN AROUND.
%
I have no vocal cords, and I must scream.
%
I haven't been opened in 500 years...
I can finally move on to the next life. Thank you...
%
I have some ideas for you but I'm keeping 'em close to my chest, sorry.
%
I hear Olivier makes his pack Mueller carry all of his belongings for him.
%
I hear the Strega Corporation made a job offer
to Noel. Please look forward to the latest in
Zemurian footwear: Noel Sneakers.
%
I hope my contents were speedrun-worthy.
%
I hope that hotpot teaches you a lesson about
taking what isn't yours.
%
I hope that item helps!
%
I hope the next chest locks you up and throws away the key!
%
I hope we can meet again someday.
%
I hope you at least made sure to not leave fingerprints on the crime scene.
%
I hope you find your happy ending.
%
I hope your pockets are now Lloyded with sepith.
%
I hope you took away a lot of happy memories from this.
%
I hope you washed your hands if you're going to double-dip.
%
I...I feel so...empty inside...
%
I... I GUESS you can keep it...
%
I-I... I can't think of anything to say!
%
I just wrote a script about the dictionary for the next Arc en Ciel production.
It's a play on words.
%
I kept telling the others it was just water weight.
Maybe now they'll believe me.
%
I knew I never should have joined Revache.
I wasn't cut out to be a boxioso.
%
I knew you'd come back to me someday!
Look, look! This is Chest Jr! Our Chest Jr!
%
I know I don't have hands, but I want to hold yours...
%
I know it's not much fun to open an empty chest,
but think about how much fun it was to open
when it still had something in it! Ah, memories.
%
I'll be taking that back now, thank you.
%
I'll give ya 1,000 mira if you give back what ya took.
%
I'll have you know that if you could take
multiple items from the same chest, the
economy would collapse.
%
I'll let you in on a little secret. There was more than
one item in here, but someone beat you to it and
took the good stuff. The bad stuff? You're holding it.
%
I'll pray to Aidios for your success.
%
I'll see you in court!
%
I love you!
%
Imagine how much more you'd have earned if you'd left this closed and
let the interest accrue.
%
I'm alive...and I'm hungry... Feeeeed meee...
%
I'm a well-known gambler among chest folk.
You can call me Gambler Jack-in-the-Box.

%
I'm empty now, but when I was younger? Adventurers couldn't keep
their hands off me!
%
I'm empty, you say? What a Liberlous statement!
%
I'M ESKIMO. THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
%
I'm glad I'm not a pirate chest. Those ARRR usually buried underground.
%
I'm glad you came to see me again, but
I really need some 'me' time right now.
%
I'm gonna have to start charging at this rate.
%
I'm here because they ran out of jokes.
%
I'm locked with a combination that hasn't been used in over a century!
How did you unlock me?
%
I'm normally not one for sappy goodbyes, but man... Who knew a chest
could shed tears?
%
I'm not actually a chestfolk, I'm a mimic. I ate the
last group of people who tried to loot me, though,
so I'm full right now. You can go.
%
I'M NOT CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ALL THESE CHEST PHRASES
%
I'm not empty. I'm making a statement.
%
I'm not so sure you understand the definition of
'empty'...
%
I'm on the highway to BELL(guard) ‚ô™
On the highway to BELL(guard) ‚ô™
Highway to BELL(guard) ‚ô™
%
I'm really glad Princess Klaudia got to
speak with Lechter again. Maybe now
she can finally have some Klosure.
%
I'm really proud of you for making it this far.
%
I'm rooting for you!
%
I'M SO GLAD YOU CHECKED THIS CHEST. I'm you,
from the future, and I came back in time and
worked on this game so I could warn you about--
%
I'm sorry, did you misunderstand something?
Only one item per person. Now go away.
%
I'm still empty. What were you expecting, a MIRAcle?
%
I'm telling my mommy on you!
%
In a flash of entrepeneurial inspiration, you decide
to pin a notice to the chest:
'For rent. Newly renovated interior. 200 mira/month.'

In a flash of entrepreneurial inspiration, you decide

%
In an infinite number of parallel universes, I have more treasure to give
to you. Not in this one, though.
%
In Crossbell...first you get the sepith,
then you get the mira,
then you get the women.
%
In loving memory of Daniel Scott Tijerina,
our fallen hero who exemplified the
indomitable spirit of Crossbell.
%
In overcoming the barriers that lie before you, may you
serve as a guide, that others may overcome their own.
%
<INSERT>
%
<Insert treasure here>
%
Inside are unholy words written in blood:
'Crossbell when?'
You etch 'Crossbell win!' below it.
%
Inside is a Mishy plush that Randy accidentally
gave to Zeit as a chew toy. He quickly shuts the
lid before Tio can see it.
%
Inside is a single piece of paper. It's a teaser for
a brand new game called 'Trails in the Chest.'
It looks boring. You put the paper down and leave.
%
Inside the chest is a blue super hero costume
with a yellow F on the chest. Dudley tilts his
glasses as they reflect in the moonlight.
%
Inside the chest is an ancient note hinting at the location of the eighth
Sept-Terrion. It crumbles to dust before you can read it.
%
Inside the chest is a tear in the fabric of reality.
DON'T poke at it.
%
Inside the chest is emptiness. That's all there ever
is. Eternal and interminable.
%
Inside the chest is emptiness. That's all there
ever is. Eternal and interminable.
%
Inside the chest is the key to its heart.
%
Inside the chest was absolutely nothing. Nothing after nothing came
bursting out.
%
Inside the chest, you discover the secret city of Chestbell.
%
Inside the chest, you find a big goose egg.
%
Inside the chest you find a smaller chest. Inside
that chest is an even smaller chest. Inside that
is another even smaller chest. Inside that chest...
%
Inside the chest, you find a tiny frog. You tap him
on the head and he happily jumps away. Cute!
%
Inside the chest you find...blood. So much blood.
Why wasn't this here the first time?!
%
Inside the chest, you find something greater than Aidios and worse
than Gehenna! Something the poor have and the rich need!
Don't try eating it, though.
%
Inside the chest, you find...the truth!
Wow, no wonder it was so hard to reach!
%
Inside the empty chest is carved:
'Olivier is handsome.'
You briefly wonder if he put that there himself.
%
Inside the treasure chest was absolutely nothing.
Nothing after nothing came bursting out.
%
Inside, you find a shirt that reads 'I checked this chest
twice and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.' You decide to
not take it with you.
%
In the chest is a Get Out of Jail Free card!
You place the chest under arrest.
The charge: facilitating a jailbreak.
%
In the dust, you can faintly make out the imprint
of whatever was in here previously.
%
In the end, maybe the real Zero was
the friends we made along the way.
...Wait.
%
I once heard on the playground that if you check
a certain chest enough, it'll give you all the items
and as much mira as you can hold!
%
I only wish I could give more, but you'll have to wait until New Game+.
%
I read all about the raid in the Chestbell Times.
...What? I like to keep achest of the news.
%
I really should have ordered that security orbment from ZCF.
%
Ironic that in a game starring police detectives
that uphold the law, there are players like you
who just want to break all the rules.
%
I rusted shut a long time ago! You must be really working out.
%
I say, didn't you loot me once before already?
%
I see you enjoy finding empty spaces.
%
I see you've found the key...to my heart. *kiss*
%
I should have listened to my parents and become a cupboard instead.
%
I should move to a palace. That way I could be a...court chester.
%
I should really think about getting a roof installed.
%
Isn't it convenient that you always find weapons that someone in your
group specializes in? You're welcome, by the way.
%
Isn't this the part where you give me something in exchange? Y'know...
like a decent human being?
%
Is that a bulge of sepith in your pocket
or are you just happy to see me?
%
Is that:
All Element Sepith x200
in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
%
Is the chest half-full or half-empty?
Neither. It's completely empty.
%
Is there anything better than treasure?
Arguably, a really good book. I'd recommend
the Sunshine Agnes series, personally.
%
Is this your way of asking me out on a date?
%
I still haven't been told what this tower
is for, so as far as I'm concerned...
Welcome to the Crossbell Chest Tower.
%
I suppose I didn't NEED that, but I mean, you
could have asked first.
%
I swear I was just holding it for a friend.
%
I swear officer, I don't know HOW that got in there!
Someone framed me, and they used mahogany to do it!
%
It contains everything you ever wanted.
Assuming everything you've ever wanted
was stale air and some dust.
%
I thought we could be friends...
%
I thought you were supposed to serve the people!
%
I thought you were supposed to serve the people!
But here you are, helping yourself!
%
It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
%
It is unbecoming for a law enforcer to be this greedy.
You lose 15 DP.
%
%
It reads, 'Ha-ha! I knew you'd be back.'
%
It's a shining pom! Wait. That's a lie...like the promise of more treasure.
%
It's a vase! It's a pot! No... It's Super Chest!
%
It's bad enough I'm wasting a week inserting all
of these chest messages. On top of it, I have to
write unique ones for cheating jerks like you.
%
It's better to have been looted and lost than
to have never been looted at all.
%
It's better to have had treasure and been looted
than to have never had treasure at all.
%
It's empty, but if you planted a seed and kept
coming back to water it, you might be able to
grow a potato or something.
%
It's empty, but if you put your head in here, you
can hear the ocean!
%
It's empty, but the woodwork is amazing!
Is it...chestnut?
%
It's empty, but you notice a little hole in the
back of the box. The view from there isn't
too bad, either!
%
It's empty, but you notice something carved on the bottom.
It says, 'The secret password is...ChairmanMeow.'[note 1]
%
It's...empty... Curses!
%
It's empty! Diabolical!
%
It's empty! Heinous!
%
It's empty. It wouldn't be in this predicament if
someone hadn't TAKEN WHAT WAS INSIDE.
%
It's empty now, but don't worry. Whoever put
that item in here probably wanted you to have
it anyway.
%
It's empty, obviously. Probably should have
thought this one through...
%
It's empty! Outrageous!
%
%
It's...empty.
This is not entirely unexpected, right?
%
It's empty! Treachery!
%
%
It's empty. You have only yourself to blame.
%
It's empty. You have only yourself to blame.
%
It's not too late in the game for Randy
to betray you. I hear he's applied to join
Ouroboros as Enforcer No. LXIX.
%
It's you! It's really you! I'm such a huge fan!! Will you sign my chest?!
%
It took years to perfect my Bellberry Juice cocktail recipe.
I always knew I could get over the berrier.
%
It was the chest of times, it was the worst of times...
%
It would have been a crime not to open me.
What charge, you ask? Resisting a-chest.
%
It wouldn't be empty if you hadn't already looted it,
now would it?
%
It wouldn't be empty if you hadn't taken the stuff in it.
%
I used to be an adventurer like you.
Then I took an arrow to the keyhole.
%
I used to be an evil chest aboard the Glorious. Thanks for inspiring me.
%
I used to be a normal chest and then some blue-haired,
labcoat-wearing jerk stored red pills inside me.
%
I've always been bothered by my pointed features,
but people tell me I'd make for a good model.
They say I have all the right angles.
%
I've been here since the raid and I really want a change of scenery.
Think I might apply for a job at the Locksmith Agency.
%
I've been looted so many times that I'm thinking of putting
in a request to the Bracer Guild to catch the culprits.
%
I've been looted two games now!
I won't stand for this much longer!
%
I've been told I have a nice chest.
%
I've been waiting for this day!
%
I've been working on the chest quotes all the live long day ‚ô™
I've been working on the chest quotes to pass the time away ‚ô™
%
I've heard if you interact with this chest 100 times while syncing
your button presses perfectly to the BGM and having your entire party's
levels be prime numbers, you'll unlock Arios as a permanent party member...
%
I've heard that Arc en Ciel's new shadow puppet performance will make 1-2 billion mira!
But I guess these are only projected figures.
%
I've never seen so many heroes up close and personal before...
%
I've spent my entire life on top of Revache's factory
and this is STILL the worst crime I've ever witnessed.
%
I waited four years for this game and all I got
was this stupid chest message.
%
I wanted to be a music box,
but I couldn't carry a tune.
%
I was filled with something once, but now there's nothing. All because of
you.
%
I was once Towergazer's Chest, but the new diet and mayor had
me renovated. Now I'm an upscale apartment for monster swarms.
%
I WAS ONE DAY AWAY FROM RETIREMENT.
%
I was sentenced 25 to life for chestslaughter.
You don't want any of this, buddy.
%
I was under the impression that this was the Geofront C-hest Sector.
I believe there's been some kind of mistake.
%
I wish I could Schera little love with you.
%
I wish I could tell you this was full of items again.
But, no. It's empty.
%
I wish I were a safe.
%
I wish you a wonderful day full of treasure chest
plundering.
%
I wonder how many treasure chests have helped you out?
%
I wonder how the Grand Chardonnay
I used to have ended up.
%
I would say I'm a down to earth chest, but now I'm down to nothing.
%
Joke's on you. This treasure wasn't tax deductible.

Kevin briefly considers taking the chest as a new weapon, but it's not
quite bow-y enough.

Kyaaaaaaaaaaa~
Without my contents I'm...bare!

Kyaaa! You've seen the most secretive part of my body! It's so

Look, I know I don't have anything, but we can
still hang out, right? Wait, come baaaaaaack!

treasure from the same chest, but no.

Look, I'm a chest and you're a human.

Looking deep into the back of the chest, you
see a tiny handwritten note that you didn't

Nice to meet you! Let's be friends.

No.

No freebies here, I'm afraid.
%
No matter how desperately you loot, you can't
find anything in the chest. The chest gives
you a smug look, prompting you to scowl back.
%
No matter where you go in this life, there's
always someone looking to take you for all you've
got. It happened to me, and it WILL happen to you.
%
No matter where you go or what events you
witness, you can rest easy knowing that this

Not exactly shy, are you?

Nothing but nothing.
%
Nothing in here but a couple of hairs. Gross...

Nothing in here but dust. Lots of dust, actually.
And a nasty smell. Wait, this chest isn't a tiny
coffin, is it?!
%
Nothing in here but the handprint of whoever
took what was inside. ...Hey, your hand looks
familiar...
%
Nothing in here. Good. We don't want people
refilling these while we're not looking.

Nothing to see here. Move along.

Now that all my contents are gone I feel so lost.
What's my purpose? Why am I here? Who am I?!

Now that I'm empty, have you considered depositing all your mira inside?

Now that you've taken my contents,
this means we're dating, right?

Now you must put something back.
Such is the law of equivalent exchange.

No, you can't return it. You don't even have the receipt!

%
Oh, great. I'm going to stay like this forever, aren't I?

Oh, hey, is there still something in here? ...Nope.

Ohhh, you found my treasure. What, you want a medal? Perhaps in
another chest.
%
Oh, no, it's a Mimic! Prepare for battle!
...Wait. No? False alarm.
%
Oh, no, not again...
%
Oh, sure. Just take it! My name's Erik, by the
way. I bet asking my name never even crossed
your mind, did it?

Scratched into the bottom of the chest is a heart containing 'Anton +.'

your actions. You don't end up putting the item back,
but it's the thought that counts, right?

tired of being opened over and over.

The lock on the front of the chest is just painted on.
%
The looters in Calvard aren't this desperate...
%
The message: Remember, there is but one truth: Love is ETERNAL.
%
The more you stare, the emptier it seems.
%
...Then the other chest told me, 'How many quartz does it take to make a
line?'
%
The only thing worse than people
like you? Are chests like me.
%
The orbal net is for Pom Pom Party.
%
The phrases 'Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,'
and, 'I'm sorry, Daddy. I've been bad,' are the same.

The real Tio would be disappointed in you.

The real treasure is buried underneath, but
you'll never be able to move me! NEVER!
%
There are mustard stains in this chest.
%
There are some...peculiar magazines inside the
chest. You decide to leave them where they are,
despite Randy's protests...

There is a 'Beware of Chest' sign. You reach to open the chest anyway
and it tries to bite your hand.
%
%
There is a note inside. It says, 'I saw what you did...'
%
There is no greater void than the one between your ears.
%
There is nothing in the chest. NOTHING.
Now shoo. Shoo!

There is nothing left in this chest, mon ami. Am I sure? Tres sure!
%
There is one thing I wanna know at this time: is Oliversic being an idiot again?

There's a certain air of royalty about this chest. Maybe this is the chest
king?

There's a crab in there. You stole its home. You monster.
%
There's a note: 'Beware the carnivorous bookshelf.'
%
There's a picture of you looting this treasure chest inside. You decide
to leave it alone.

There's nothing in the chest but spiders now.
They all stare at you and clap. Bravo.
%
There's nothing in the chest, but the air
inside is strangely...humid.

good to pretend.

There's nothing in this chest, but you imagine all
the things that COULD'VE been...

There's nothing in this chest, but you looked so
excited to open it that I didn't have the heart to
tell you earlier.
%
There's nothing on the chest but your failed
hopes and dreams for more loot.

There's some green hair inside. The chest prays to Aidios this sinful
priest gets his just desserts.
%
There's this great story I want to Estell you
sometime.
%
There was a fishing hole here. It's gone now.
%
There was an item here. It's gone now.

There was a treasure here. It's gone now.

These are the kinds of stories that turn into legends.

These two games have been a big part of my life for five years.
I'm not certain what future projects I'll take part in, but it's going
to be hard to surpass the satisfaction I feel for these two. -- 'JJL'
%
the stuff out. You wouldn't know who did that now,
would you?
%
The surgery to remove the foreign object was
successful. The chest just needs to be closed
up and allowed a full recovery. Good job.
%
The treasure chest activates its power to stop time!
Fortunately, it can't do anything, either, so nothing
happens while you read this text.
%
%
The treasure chest is offended that you have returned.
Was the first time not good enough for you?
%
The treasure chest reveals itself to be a crafty mimic, and licks your
unsuspecting hand. Better break out the disinfectant.

The treasure was you all along!

The true result of the Non-Aggression Pact is not
technological exchange, but the spread of talkative
treasure chests previously native to Liberl.

The true result of the Non-Aggression Pact is not
technological exchange, but the spread of talkative
treasure chests that previously were only in Liberl.
%
The truth is, there's only one treasure chest in
this entire world. It just follows you around, filling
itself with new goods for you to plunder.
%
The truth of the Zemurian continent is that Aidios--
[this chest message has been confiscated by the
Congregation for the Sacraments].
%
The ventilation here is your biggest fan,
and yet you just go and shut it down!
%
The weight of the chest's lid causes it to shear
off of its old hinges. Awkwardly, you put the lid
back on and try to pretend nothing happened.
%
The words 'Renne,' 'Rend,' and 'End' combine to make...what, exactly?
Be sure to keep this hint in mind.
%
They all look the same to you now. Every one
of them, so helpless, so vulnerable--a mere
target for you and your insatiable hunger.
%
They don't pay me enough to come up with chest
messages that you can only see with debug or in
the database. Actually, they don't pay me at all.
%
They're Tear-Alls because they're made from the tears
of all the chests whose items have been plundered.
%
They said Crossbell would never be localized,
but you shouldn't believe everything you read
on the orbal network.
%
They say it's what's on the inside that counts. Now look what you've
done.

They say that to err is human. Indeed,
by your hands, I am now naught but air.

The Zemurian metric system has a few obscure
measurements that don't get talked about often.
For example, salt is measured in Grahams.

Things are going in some interesting directions, eh?
No wonder they call him Detour Crois.
%
Think I can get a stained glass window installed on me?
%
Thinking you've come back to return its stuff,
the chest opens wide in anticipation. As you
leave, it closes with a pained, awkward creak.
%
Think outside the box. Er, chest.
%
Think you can just take my stuff and run off?
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
%
This chest contains the meaning of life.
%
This chest has a content respawn rate of zero percent.

This chest has cursed you with the insatiable urge to check all the other
empty chests.

This chest is as empty as my well of creativity
after writing all of these messages.

made. You know which one.

This chest is as empty as your soul.

This chest is as empty as your soul!

This chest is better than others. Why?

took back inside.

But you're gonna wear the Crest Charm anyway, aren't you?

This chest is empty. You looted it already.
This is a haiku.

digging through it and pillaging everything it
had. You can't remember when...

other treasure chest friends. But beauty on the

This is a nice chest
This is also a haiku
Chest chest chest chest chest
%
This is empty. Not even half-empty,
just plain empty.
%
This is not entirely unexpected, right?
%
This is the 56th chest you've opened! Congrats!
Nah, just kidding. I'm not even COUNTING.
%
This is the Geofront hidden below Tokyo-3.
NERV's protection from the angels' assault.
Oh, wait a minute. Wrong franchise. Silly me.

This is what your curiosity gets you.
%
This is where I would put my item...
IF I HAD ONE!
%
This series set my path in life with its incredible focus on attention to detail.
I was led to finding a community--a group of friends and passionate fans.
Together, we made two wonders we can be eternally proud of. -- 'NB'

This situation seems familiar somehow...

This... This is not what it looks like!

This time, I did NOT clap when he used
the Eight Leaves One Blade style.

This treasure chest graduated at the top of its
class at the Riches Royal Academy.
%
This treasure chest is on strike until further
notice.
%
This treasure chest was supposed to have a witty saying, but we drew a
Bleublanc.
%
This treasure is actually still full of treasure.
Problem is, the rest of the monsters are on break.
Sorry, kid.
%
This tree didn't IMPEDE you from seeing me.
%
This wasn't easy, but you persevered.
%
Though it had its ups and downs, I'm grateful for the
opportunity working on these two games gave me. -- 'AZ'

Thought you could get more, did you?
Sorry, pal--no duplicates. Chest la vie.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand police-
stealing-from-treasure-chest jokes. The humor is extremely subtle,
and without a solid grasp of Crossbell State law, most of the jokes
will go over a typical player's head.
%
Tooooooooo late...
%
To the guy who invented zero:
Thanks for nothing!
%
Trails in the Sky the 3rd was delayed for five years to come up with more
treasure chest phrases.
%
Trails means the world to me. I'm happy I could share my world with you.
Thank you for giving this wonderful series a chance. -- 'B'
%
Trails means the world to me, too. I'm grateful I could
share my world and my favorite story in it with you.
Thank you for giving us a chance. -- 'DST'

Unable to see the bottom of this ostensibly
empty chest, you drop a pebble into it. You don't
hear it hit the bottom. ...Probably best to leave.
%
Unfortunately, what you stole from me won't help relieve you of your
kleptomaniac issues.
%
Until next time, see ya.
%
Upon closer inspection, you notice this chest is made of Grimwood.
Don't panic, but you've just robbed the relative of a lawyer.
%
Upon closer inspection, you see a chess board in the chest.
You move the white rook to E4. Chestmate.
Wow, thank you so much for playing the game twice!
I guess you could say Azure doesn't lose its...luster.
%
Upon further inspection, you found a Zeram Capsule.
...Pfft. You wish.
%
Upon searching the chest a second time, you discover
the hoops that had to be jumped through in order to
implement these messages.
%
Use it well, comrade in rods.
%
Use that rod to give the Imperial Fishing Club a taste of their
own medicine. They're so snobby, and they never allow my
Erebonian chest buddies to get a word in edgewise.
%
Use the code WISHYWITHMISHY to get 500 mira
off your next Crossbell Eats order.
%
Using debug, I see. Did you know that if you debug your
way over here in Zero that the door to C Sector is also there?
It opens but doesn't go anywhere. Same for the lighthouse!
%
Victim's Memoirs: I ate my friend today. What else was I supposed to do?
I was starving. We both were. And there's no food here. So we decided,
together, that one of us should try to live just a little bit longer.
%
Wait a second, you're not Adol!
WHERE AM I?!
%
Wait, Father! I haven't finished my confession yet!
%
Wait, you don't live in Villa-Raisins.
Get outta here!
%
Please close my lid. Can't you see how much
confetti I'm collecting?
%
Wait, you don't live in Villa-Raisins.
Get outta here!
%
Warning: Chest must be filled past this line in order to operate properly!
%
Warning: Do not store children or other living creatures in chest.
%
Was returning here another...BRIGHT IDEA?
%
Watch out! There's been somebody going around
looting all my friends, and I think he just got me!
%
Watch out! This chest has nothing to lose!
There's no telling what it might do!
%
%
Way to be thorough, hero!
%
We are both empty.
%
Wear good shoes and you'll never see de feet.
%
We chestfolk are actually in the middle of a war.
I can't give you more items because I'm rationing.
Good luck with your quest, though.

treasure BARRELS.

Welcome to the Crossbell Watchtower.
...We don't know what it's for, either.
%
Welcome to the Geofront. I promise this dungeon
won't take as long as the other Geofront.
%
Well, an empty chest is good for sitting and resting. Come, sit down.
Sit down and rest.
%
Well, at least it's not another Abbadon Potluck.
%
Well... Crap.
%
Well, hello! Welcome to Treasure Chest Village.
You sure are a funny looking treasure chest...
%
Well, I see you're not above asking for seconds.
%
Well, it's been swell. See you again on New Game+.
%
We need to talk.
%
Wenn ist das Nunst√ºck git und Slotermeyer? Ja!

We ran out of ideas for messages, so take this treasure instead.
%
We're sorry; The fairies haven't restocked
this chest yet. Please come visit again soon.
%
We're working on a mod that replaces Randy with
a pepperoni pizza. Please look forward to it.
%
Were you hoping somebody would come along
and put in MORE stuff for you to take?
%
Were you the one who made me feel empty inside?
%
We tried getting the Randy pepperoni pizza
mod to work in Zero, but it kept making the
game run at four-cheese frames per second.
%
What are you still doing here?! You're a priest, for Aidios' sake!
%
%
What depraved individual would do something like this?!
%
What did you expect to find in here?
%
What do a shirtless guy and what you're looking at now have in common?
A bare chest.
%
What do you call a crocodile wearing a waistcoat?
An investi-gator.

What do you say when your divine wolf sneezes?
...Goodhoundzeit!
%
Whatever riches once lay in this chest,
it's just an empty vessel now.
%
What happens when you clear out every chest
in the world? What will OTHER adventurers do
then?
%
What if our universe is a chest in someone ELSE's
universe, and someone's going to open us up,
take everything, and just keep coming back?
%
What if the world you live in is actually a gigantic chest?
%
...What? I'm not on the clock, so screw off.
They don't pay me enough to make witty
remarks to players using debug.
%
What is Zemuria's favorite brand of popcorn?
Orbal Redenbacher.
%
What makes the chests of Liberl so talkative, anyway? Most other
countries prefer strong, silent chests.
%
What more do you want from me...BLOOD?!
%
What's the difference between an RPG protagonist and a rare
metal collector? One treasures your steel, and the other steals
your treasure.
%
What? There's nothing in here? BOOO-RIIING.
%
%
What? The stuff you took before wasn't enough?
%
What? The stuff you took before wasn't enough?
%
What, were you born in a barn?!
%
What were you expecting to find here?
%
What were you hoping to find? One of the Sept-Terrions?
%
What would Aidios say if She saw what
you were doing?
%
What you have taken from this chest, you
can never restore.
%
What? You thought that because it's a fan translation,
all you would find is 'The chest is empty'?
%
When choosing whether to stick with the old font or
use a new one, there was a fair amount of arguments
over it, but we eventually reached a Cuprumise.
%
When I asked to be locked up, this isn't what I had in mind.
%
When I said, 'Give me some space,' this isn't exactly what I had in
mind...
%
When I was told I needed to lose weight, this was not what I had in mind.
%
When the SSS needed to recruit a skilled negotiator,
marksman, and second-in-command, there was only
one candidate that was Elie-gible.
%
When you gaze long enough into the empty
chest, the chest gazes back into you.
%
When you stare too long into the chest, the chest
stares back at you.
%
When you think about it, aren't we all a little
empty inside?
%
Where does that ladder upstairs lead, you ask?
I...actually don't know, either. I wish I knew.
%
Where do treasure chests come from?
Well, when a carpenter and pile of lumber
love each other very much...
%
Whether light or dark, rain or shine, up or down...
We know you can win this!
%
Which idiot named it 'insomnia' and
not 'resisting a rest'?
%
Which of your party members blocks entrances
the best? AGATE!
%
Which one do you think is a bigger mess?
Crossbell's political climate or Ilya's room?
%
While you're here, don't forget to like,
comment, and chestscribe.
%
Whoa, slow your roll there, pal!
You can't even DO the quest that's useful for yet.
%
Who hides their valuables in chests out in the
open? This is supposed to be a modern nation,
y'know!
%
Why am I not surprised that Neue Blanc's
most-ordered drinks are Bloody Shirlies
and Jaegermeisters?
%
Why are you leaving me open? I'm starting to be cold!
%
Why did you have to come back? You could've
just walked away with the goods, but now the
treasure chest has you right where it wants you!
%
Why do Puck and Roose hate Zhang Hui's lectures?
Because they're Long and Laod.
%
Why do they call it the GeoFRONT if it's under the city?
...Thank you. I'll be here all game.
%
'Why do they call the Enigma II an ORBment?
The quartz are square. The frame is square.
They should call it a SQUAREment.'
'That's goldia, Jerry! Goldia!'
%
Why is Deen called the Spinach Fiend, anyway? Does he just really like
Spinach?
%
Why is he the Divine Blade of Wind?
Because he's Airy-os! I'm sorry, that
was pretty MacLame.
%
Why would a talking chest like me choose to live in
a place like this? You'd be surprised how badly D‚à¥G
tanked the property values here. Rent is dirt cheap!
%
(Will write flavor text for food)
%
With the item you took still in your hand,
you look at the chest. It looks back at you
with an expression that says '...Bruh.'
%
Wood are you looking at?
%
WOOO! YEEEAAH...! W-Wait...
Why did only six people come
to MY unveiling ceremony?
%
Would you also like a coffee? By the way, that was a rhetorical question.
%
Would you like to join our order, O‚à¥E?
We teach that if a chest is open, it is
therefore empty.
%
Wow, a sequel to Trails in the Chest?
I can't believe the Geofront got a
chest-selling author to work on Azure.
%
Wow, could you at least ASK before opening me?
%
Wow! Look at all this air!
%
Wow... You're the first human to ever take
something from me! I'm so excited!
%
Yeah, well, my cousin's Erebonian and
he didn't even GET a message!
%
Yep, it's empty.
%
Y'know, I used to contain a bottle of Grand Chardonnay.
I wonder what became of it. Last I heard, it ended up
in Liberl.
%
Y'know, I used to work at St. Ursula's Medical College
for a bit, but I quit because I couldn't stand their uniforms.
They were just so tight around the chest.
%
Y'know what song I have stuck in my head? Neither do I.
%
You admire the chest's curves and luscious locks.
%
YOU again!
%
You again? At least Phantom Thief B is a gentleman!
%
You already got the treasure. Don't be greedy!
%
You already took everything it had to offer. What more do you want?!
%
You are now breathing manually.
That's my revenge for taking that quartz.
%
You are sucked into the chest. A teacher forces
you to write 'I will not steal from treasure chests'
100 times on a chalkboard before you can leave.
%
You are the *real* treasure.
%
You begin to suspect that this treasure chest is
a portal to the Meat Dimension.
%
You briefly imagine what it would be like to be stuck in a box for
decades, only to be stolen by an adventuring treasure hunter.
%
You briefly wonder how many jelly beans you
could fit in a treasure chest of this size.
%
You brute! I can't believe you took my chestity like that!
You had better take responsibility!
%
You came back! *BLUSH*
%
You came back! I knew you would!
%
You came back! You actually came back for me!
%
You can argue over who best boy is, but I think
we can all agree that Zeit is goodest boy.
%
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE MY SIGHT.
%
You can save the world, but you can't remember
whether you've looted a chest once or not?
%
%
You can take my contents, but you'll
never take MY FREEEEDOOOOOM!
%
You can't even DO the quest that's useful for yet.
Baby... What is you doin'?
%
You check the chest and find this text box.
It is a very good text box, I assure you.
Very well written.
%
You check the chest to see it full of fan mail
addressed to the SSS. It's sweet, but you
wonder how it got there.
%
You deserve a win. I'll be right here and cheering you on every step of
the way.
%
You didn't earn that and you know it.
%
You discover all of Anton's old love letters.
After reading one, you can't bring yourself
to read the others.
%
You don't find anything this time, but maybe if
you kept on opening and closing this one chest
over and over again... (Don't actually do this.)
%
You don't have to go back to the SSS
building but you can't stay here.
%
You don't understand how hard it is to come up
with five hundred unique treasure chest phrases
that are brimming with sarcasm.
%
You don't understand! I coulda had items. I coulda been a treasure.
I could've been something...instead of empty.
%
You do realize you could have
just taken the stairs, right?
%
You ever stop and think about how the CPD
awarded you 5 DP for breaking out of prison?
%
You ever wonder if the items in these chests
were meant for someone specific? And you have
the nerve to take them anyway. How rude.
%
You feel a sharp gaze stare at you from inside the void.
Whose eyes are those?
%
You feel a sharp gaze stare at you from inside the void.
Whose eyes are those eyes?
%
You find a bag of round breath fresheners in the chest.
They're labeled, 'Epstein Orb Mints: Leman Flavor.'
The chest is empty.
%
You find a message scratched along the
bottom: 'Loot this chest and do your worst.
But be warned, for ye be cursed.'
%
You find a Mishy plush inside of the chest.
A lone tear rolls down its cheek as it is
disappointed in you for breaking the game.
%
You find a notebook with a gauntlet on it. You
decide to leave it in case the owner comes back.
%
You find a skeleton wearing a nametag
reading 'M.T. Chester.' Sorry, that was a lie.
You don't find anything.
%
You find a small pile of chest messages that were
deemed unsuitable for a commercial release.
%
You find a torn note that says: 'chest No. 53 wuz here'
%
You find a veritable mountain of chest messages
that were considered too crude for publication.
%
You find a whole bunch of caterpillars. They're
crawly and gross. But they'll grow up into
butterflies! Or moths. Moths are kinda gross, too...
%
You find fingerprints inside the chest that point to
the likely culprit behind its contents' theft.
Three guesses as to who that is.

%
You find only a bleak, empty void.
%
You find what appears to be a botched attempt
at Fierce Tiger Chao Fan. Elie suddenly seems to
be in a hurry to leave the area.
%
You flip open the lid, knowing full well you won't
find anything. You're still somehow disappointed
by the result.
%
You flip the chest upside down and open it, hoping
to open a secret subsection yet to be looted.
You find nothing, and now your arms are tired.
%
You forgot to say the magic word.
%
You found a fine layer of dust!
%
You found a plank of wood, but it seems to be nailed down.
%
You found a scarf to stop explosions.
Just kidding. Wrong kind of penguin.
%
You found...a whole lotta nothing.
%
You found the greatest gift of all: love.
%
You found the greates treasure of all: Friendship.
%
You gaze deeply into the empty chest, hoping for enlightenment.
...You feel hungry.
%
You gaze into the empty black void of the chest
and, for a fleeting moment, feel very small.
%
You got away with running your hands down
this random chest once. Don't push your luck.
%
You got something with your eyes? Because this is the second time
you're checking my contents.
%
You grimace in horror at the anatomically
correct treasure chest.
%
<YOU HAVE ACTIVATED THE STARING CONTEST>
%
You have found: disappointment.
%
%
You have found: the missing link.
%
You have found: the missing link.
%
You have found the ultimate treasure...air.
%
You have found the ultimate treasure...oxygen.
%
You have found: zilch, nada, nothing...
%
You have returned. The pact is sealed.
Your first born child is mine.
%
You have to be thorough to open all of my
buddies in this game. You know what they
say: There's no chest for the weary.
%
You hear some funky music playing from within the chest, but you do not
see any instruments.
%
You imagine this chest as it once was,
brimming with treasure and full of delight.
You can hardly bear to look at it now.
%
You just gave me indichestion.
%
You kick the chest open, but all you get for your
talented footwork is a stubbed toe. Ow.
%
You killed my only friends, so tell me...
Who's the REAL monster here?
%
You know, I bet you can resolve this whole
thing peacefully if you challenge the good
doctor to a fishing duel.
%
You know, I'm worth a hell lot more sepith than that lousy trinket you just
took!
%
You know, maybe the real treasure was the treasure inside of me all along.
Seriously. Give it back.
%
You know the chest is empty, but it has
served you well. Instead of opening it, you give
it a gentle pat on the head.
%
You know there's no achievement for
reading all of these, right?
%
You know this chest is empty, so why do you do
this to yourself? Why do you keep hoping?
%
You know what they say:
...
I wouldn't know. I've always been here.
%
You know what they say:
...
I wouldn't know, though. I spend all my time here.
%
You know you're a Kiseki fan when you're watching sports
and you hear '...trails at the half' very differently.
%
You lift the chest over your head and shake as
hard as you can, but nothing comes out. Well,
it was an impressive display of strength, at least.
%
You'll always be my hero, you know?
%
You'll get not one sepith more from me, you fiend!
%
You'll take a lost child with you, but not me.
I see how it is.
%
You look at the chest. The chest looks at you.
You both know that neither of you have anything
left to give.
%
You look back in the chest, thinking you might have
missed something, and find a tiny bearded man
in a pointy hat doing a little dance.
%
You look, but there are no small children in THIS trunk.
%
You look mighty familiar...
Didn't we meet last game?
%
You look under the chest, hoping to find the
keys to a BRAND NEW AIRSHIP! ...You don't find
anything.
%
You may be asking what happened to the SSS's
leftover sepith in Trails from Zero. What, you think
you can put KeA through college on a CPD salary?
%
You may have heard that Calvard has lax immigration policies.
It's true! Most of my fellow Altair chests had parents and
grandparents that came from Liberl and Crossbell.
%
You may have met my brethren. Between
you and me...they're a little unhinged.
%
You mean two games full of these cheesy phrases wasn't enough?
%
YOU might look at this chest and think itssic empty,
but that's just negative thinking. Others see this
baby and marvel at the amazing air inside.
%
You murderer! Those monsters were lawful
tenants who paid rent!
%
You nearly tear the top of the chest of its
hinges in your excitement to open it. Your face
falls as you realize there's nothing inside.
%
You need the 'More Chest Messages' DLC
to view this message.
%
You obtain 80,000,000 imaginary mira.
%
You obtain...NOTHING! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
%
You obtain the Emperor's New Clothes. Not.
%
You obtain the Sword of the Ancient
God-Kings. Just kidding, it's empty.
%
You open a chest to find a bandanaed man
hiding inside! Just kidding, it's empty.
%
You open the chest and peer downward, only
to find a clay hand making a certain gesture.
Got 'em.
%
You open the chest and see riches beyond your
wildest imagination. As you take your first step
in your victory dance, you awaken. It was a dream.
%
You open the chest and see something you didn't
notice the first time around. Without warning, the
chest slams itself shut. You cannot open it again.
%
You open the chest and wait for an item to
levitate from the chest and into your hands.
Nothing happens.
%
You open the chest, eyes wild with avarice.
Your face falls as you realize you've already
taken everything.
%
You open the chest, finding a scrap of paper
with some writing on it: 'This pun is tearable.'
You groan as you close the lid.
%
You open the chest. Inside is a tiny Pom.
It would wave, but it has no arms.
%
You open the chest, ponder putting the item you
took from it back, and close it again with a soft
smile.
%
You open the chest, realize you already looted it,
then angrily slam the lid back down.
%
You open the chest so quickly that it catches
fire, scorching its contents to ashes. Maybe
this'll teach you to contain your excitement!
%
You open the chest to find a message scrawled
in blood along the underside of the lid:
'WHOEVER TOOK MY STUFF WILL PAY.' Huh.
%
You open the chest to find hundreds of hissing
snakes and immediately close it again. Good
thing you already got whatever item was in there.
%
You open the chest to see a man's face
just smiling at you. Unsettled, you back away
and close the lid. Let's not open that one again.
%
You open the chest to the familiar sight of
nothing. Oh, how you've missed this!
%
%
You open the empty chest and stare inside. The chest stares back accusingly.
%
You open the empty chest open again and again,
cackling manically to yourself. You KNOW it
contains some secret. It just has to!
%
You open the lid. A piercing scream fills the air.
You quickly shut the lid and walk away.
%
You peer deep inside the chest once again,
only to bump your head against the lid as
you stand back up. Serves you right.
%
You pick up an invitation for a fighting game but
put it down so you can focus on support requests.
%
You realize that was in my stomach until just now, right? Yuck!
%
You're almost there! Keep going!
%
You're causing terrible, terrible damage across this kingdom. How does
it feel?
%
You're doing it! You're doing it!
%
You're finally at the end.
Don't give up now!
%
You're from the city? Do you know my pal, Lyd?
He comes by all the time to watch the trains.
%
You're going to love the sequel.
It's called Trails to One.
%
You're going to love the sequel.
It's called Trails to ZX Advent.
%
You're good to go!
%
You're near the end. I'm sure you're strong enough to overcome!
%
You're next.
%
You're not diggin this 'One item per chest'
thing, are you?
%
You're...not going to kidnap me, are you?
%
You're really going to take that EP Cut 1?
Haven't the Armoricans been through enough?
%
You rest your head atop the empty chest.
You rapidly withdraw as you hear what sounds
like a heartbeat.
%
You're sucked into the chest and end up in a chest-based
world with no way back. Decades go by, your memories of
Crossbell fade, and as your life comes to an end, you take
your final breath...only to wake up. It was all a dream!
%
You're the sister here. Does 'Thou shall not steal' ring any bells?
%
Your excuse for thievery is as wooden as I am.
%
You're... You're opening me again? Heeheehee...
How naughty...
%
Your friends will always stand by you. When you're happy, they're happy.
And when you're hurt, they'll hurt, too. Try to share all your feelings with
your friends so you can be happy and cry together.
%
Your investigation into the theft of this chest comes
up empty, much like the chest itself. You conveniently
ignore the fact that you are the thief.
%
Your luscious locks of hair are NOTHING compared to my lovely locks of
steel!
%
Your request for a rare, ultra powered quartz from
before the Septian Calendar is being processed.
Please stand by.
%
Your secrets are safe with me.
%
You rummage around and see dozens of rejected chest messages
where 'azure' was used as a pun on 'assure.'
%
You scour every square inch of this chest's
empty innards, desperate to find any scrap of
treasure you missed.
%
You see a heart carved around 'Adol + Dogi.'
Where did this chest COME from?
%
You see a human skeleton that wasn't in there before.
%
You see a kitten curled up in the chest. Aww...
It's so cute... As a result of acute kittenitis, you
forgot to take whatever else was left inside.
%
You see a single tear roll down its treasure chest
cheek. Wait a second... Chests don't have tear
ducts...
%
You seem to be laboring under the hope that something
else will magically appear in this empty chest.
Let me quash that for you right now.
%
You should treasure every moment.
%
You sit down in the empty chest. You feel safe
here. Conscious that you're being stared at, you
crawl out, sheepishly.
%
You sneakily crack the lid of the chest and take
a peek inside. Sadly, no treasure chest fairies
flying around in there. No items, either.
%
You take my stuff, I take your stuff!
%
You tell the chest to 'say aaah,' and it obliges.
Everything seems to be in order here!
%
You think I could use an inner paint job?
%
You tip the lid back and thrust your hand
into the chest. Your hand hits the bottom of the
chest and you skin your knuckles.
%
You took a gamble on something being in this
chest, and I'm afraid you lost.
%
You took all I had to give. Happy now?
%
You took all my loot. How am I supposed to pay my room and board now?
%
You took everything from me... Everything!
...
Well, at least I still have my charming personality.
%
You took the time to talk to me even when you're this busy? Heehee.
You're so sweet.
%
You try watering the chest to see if
something will sprout, but the only thing
that grows is the smell.
%
You've already looted this chest right down to
the bare bottom.
%
You've already looted this chest. You briefly
pause to wonder if that's legal.
%
You've already looted this chest. You might
have might havesic forgotten, but don't think you
can just come waltzing back and apologize.
%
You've already taken everything this chest
ever had. Have you come back to gloat?
%
You've been demanding it, so here it is.
The long-awaited sequel: Trails in the Chest 2!
...What do you mean the game's almost over?
%
You've been demanding it, so here it is.
The long-awaited sequel: Trails in the Chest, Pt. II!
...What do you mean the game's almost over?
%
You've looted this chest already.
It's strange...it almost feels heavier now.
%
You've played this game twice and still don't
understand that open means empty?
%
You've really opened me up to new possibilites.
%
You've seen a lot of empty chests
chests in your day, but you've really
gotta say, this one's the finest.
%
You've stolen my treasure...and my heart.
%
You've taken away my one purpose in life.
%
You've taken everything from me...
EVERYTHING!
%
You were so patient. Was it worth the wait?
%
You will not find a finer empty chest.
%
You wonder if you could use arts to turn this
chest into a small, wooden bathtub. Water would
probably fine. Fire to heat it, likely not.
%
ZCF and Mishelam Wonderland collaborated to invent
new playground equipment. But after months of work,
all they came up with was a swing and a Mish.
%
Zeit was going to be the CPD's new mascot, but they
wanted him to wear a hat and trenchcoat and say the
catchphrase, 'Take a Zeit out of crime.'
%
Zzz... Zzz...
(The chest appears to be drooling in its sleep.)
