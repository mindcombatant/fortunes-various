The chest is empty...because of you. Nice work, hero.
%
By looking inside this chest again, you flunk! ...Just kidding.
%
Not a thing remains in the chest except a lonely, dead spider.
%
The chest is empty. I wonder whose fault that is...?
%
This chest is now full of disappointment...
%
You already got the treasure. Don't be greedy!
%
The chest mocks you with its emptiness.
%
You already took everything it had to offer. What more do you want?!
%
%
I'd ask yourself how long that Potluck has
been in this chest and if you feel lucky.
%
%
The chest is empty...
Ha-HA! Got you!
%
The chest is empty. ...Shocked?
%
The chest is empty. ...Surprised?
%
Back for more, eh?
Some people are never satisfied...
%
The chest is o' so very empty. 
%
The chest is empty. So very empty...
%
The chest is empty...but it wouldn't be
empty if you put something in it.
%
...Nope, still empty.
%
Reduced to searching empty chests?
That's really sad.
%
I AM ERROR
%
It's empty, but you notice something carved on the bottom.
It says, 'The secret password is...ChairmanMeow.'[note 1]
%
Limit: One per adventurer. -Dev Team
%
Don't touch it! It's EMPTY!
%
It's...empty... Curses!
%
the stuff out. You wouldn't know who did that now,
would you?
%
%
I feel so empty...
%
You've taken everything from me...
EVERYTHING!
%
The chest has been cleaned out! Villainous!
%
%
The treasure chest is offended that you have returned.
Was the first time not good enough for you?
%
The chest is empty... How tragic...
%
The chest is already empty, you double-dipper!
%
The chest is empty.
Makes you wanna cry, doesn't it?
%
The chest is empty...because you emptied it.
Funny how that works, no?
%
The chest has nothing left to offer you. 
%
Nothing to see here. Move along.
%
This situation seems familiar somehow...
%
%
Fill this chest with your tears because it is empty!
%
Fill this chest with your tears because it is empty!
%
Alzheimer's much?
%
You forgot to say the magic word.
%
%
You can take my contents, but you'll
never take MY FREEEEDOOOOOM!
%
I...I feel so...empty inside...
%
%
Reduced to searching empty chests?
That's really sad.
%
You have found: disappointment.
%
<Insert treasure here>
%
It's empty! Treachery!
%
You have found the ultimate treasure...oxygen.
%
The clowns told me you'd be back...
%
You seem to be laboring under the hope that something
else will magically appear in this empty chest.
Let me quash that for you right now.
%
What, were you born in a barn?!
%
%
%
%
So, when do you plan on giving me my stuff back?
%
Feed me, Seymour!
%
The item fairy has yet to make her second rounds today. 
%
The chest is empty...like your thieving heart.
%
The chest is empty...because you removed
the contents, you looter!
%
...Nope, still empty.
%
Reduced to searching empty chests?
That's really sad.
%
The chest is empty...because you've already been here.
%
Ah-ha! You again!
%
The chest is empty, but you may
now fill it with your tears.
%
You have found: the missing link.
%
You have found: zilch, nada, nothing...
%
It wouldn't be empty if you hadn't already looted it,
now would it?
%
It's empty! Diabolical!
%
more treasure is going to appear in this chest.
%
%
%
%
You have found: the missing link.
%
You came back! I knew you would!
%
Double-dipping is against the rules.
%
It's empty! Outrageous!
%
It's empty! Heinous!
%
It's empty! Diabolical!
%
You found...a whole lotta nothing.
%
The chest is empty...because you've already been here.
%
An empty chest is a tragic thing indeed.
%
Ah-ha! You again!
%
%
It's empty. You have only yourself to blame.
%
No soup for you!
%
It wouldn't be empty if you hadn't already looted it,
now would it?
%
You will not find a finer empty chest.
%
This is not entirely unexpected, right?
%
Hahahaha...no.
%
I'll be taking that back now, thank you.
%
The chest is empty... Nefarious!
%
The chest is empty but covered in scratches.
It spells out, 'Mr. Tiddles was here.'[note 1]
%
%
What depraved individual would do something like this?!
%
An empty chest! Scandalous!
%
The chest is empty? Madness! Madness? MADNESS!
%
The chest is empty... Nefarious! 
%
What more do you want from me...BLOOD?!
%
<Silent Disapproval>
%
%
%
The chest is empty. I blame you.
%
The chest is so empty it hurts.
%
The chest is empty. Are you surprised?
%
Don't be shocked now, but...it's empty.
%
I say, didn't you loot me once before already?
%
The chest is empty...because you emptied it.
Thief!
%
Treasure doesn't respawn, you know.
%
The chest is so very, very, very empty.
%
%
It reads, 'Ha-ha! I knew you'd be back.'
%
%
%
Limit: One per hero. -Dev Team
%
So you've returned...
%
%
%
%
There is a note inside. It says, 'I saw what you did...'
%
This chest has been picked clean...
%
Tooooooooo late...
%
%
%
%
You open the empty chest and stare inside. The chest stares back accusingly.
%
This chest is now full of disappointment...
%
What did you expect to find in here?
%
That's really sad.
%
%
It's...empty.
This is not entirely unexpected, right?
%
Treasure doesn't respawn, you know.
%
You have found the ultimate treasure...air.
%
%
%
%
Way to be thorough, hero!
%
%
What? The stuff you took before wasn't enough?
%
It's empty. You have only yourself to blame.
%
What, were you born in a barn?!
%
The chest is empty... Nefarious!
%
What? The stuff you took before wasn't enough?
%
The chest is empty...because you've already been here.
%
%
%
Say, haven't we met before?
%
An empty chest is a tragic thing indeed.
%
It's empty! Treachery!
%
The chest is so empty it hurts.
%
The chest is empty. Are you surprised?
%
YOU again!
%
It wouldn't be empty if you hadn't taken the stuff in it.
%
%
%
You came back! I knew you would!
%
So, when do you plan on giving me my stuff back?
%
This is what your curiosity gets you.
%
A small spider skitters from one side of the empty
chest to the other. It's actually kind of cute...
%
What? There's nothing in here? BOOO-RIIING.
%
For Sale: Reviving Balm, never used.
%
You open the chest to the familiar sight of
nothing. Oh, how you've missed this!
%
Oh, sure. Just take it! My name's Sven, by the
way. I bet asking my name never even crossed
your mind, did it?
%
There is nothing in the chest. NOTHING.
Now shoo. Shoo!
%
The empty chest opens with a groan. I guess it's
tired of being opened over and over.
%
Can I help you?
Oh, wait. YOU ALREADY HELPED YOURSELF.
%
You open the chest, realize you already looted it,
then angrily slam the lid back down.
%
TREASURE CHEST ADVERTISING FOR THE LOW,
LOW PRICE OF 900 MIRA PER MONTH.
%
Dang, you REALLY like reading these messages,
don't you?
%
You're... You're opening me again? Heeheehee...
How naughty...
%
You open the chest and see riches beyond your
wildest imagination. As you take your first step
in your victory dance, you awaken. It was a dream.
%
Look, I know I don't have anything, but we can
still hang out, right? Wait, come baaaaaaack!
%
Psychically sensing that there's nothing inside,
you walk away from the chest without disturbing
it.
%
Why did you have to come back? You could've
just walked away with the goods, but now the
treasure chest has you right where it wants you!
%
This chest looks sad and deflated now that
you've taken all its stuff.
%
You ever wonder if the items in these chests
were meant for someone specific? And you have
the nerve to take them anyway. How rude.
%
You tell the chest to 'say aaah,' and it obliges.
Everything seems to be in order here!
%
The chest is empty now. So empty. So lonely.
Please don't go...
%
Sorry, kid. I'm retired.
%
You've looted this chest already.
It's strange...it almost feels heavier now.
%
As you close the chest, it gives you a sad look.
It wishes it had something more for you, too.
%
You know the chest is empty, but it has
served you well. Instead of opening it, you give
it a gentle pat on the head.
%
You can save the world, but you can't remember
whether you've looted a chest once or not?
%
There's this great story I want to Estell you
sometime.
%
This is the 56th chest you've opened! Congrats!
Nah, just kidding. I'm not even COUNTING. 
%
Could just be your imagination, but...it's empty.
%
So...what really stops you from wearing more
than two accessories? Social decorum?
%
When you gaze long enough into the empty
chest, the chest gazes back into you.
%
Watch out! This chest has nothing to lose!
There's no telling what it might do!
%
Inside the chest you find...blood. So much blood.
Why wasn't this here the first time?!
%
I'll have you know that if you could take
multiple items from the same chest, the
economy would collapse.
%
You nearly tear the top of the chest of its
hinges in your excitement to open it. Your face
falls as you realize there's nothing inside.
%
This chest is holding a beauty pageant with all its
other treasure chest friends. But beauty on the
outside can't save how empty it is on the inside.
%
You open the chest to see a man's face
just smiling at you. Unsettled, you back away
and close the lid. Let's not open that one again.
%
This chest was once full of wondrous
treasures. Then you came along.
%
Looking into yet another empty chest, you
wonder who leaves all of these lying around
unlocked.
%
You've seen a lot of empty chests
chests in your day, but you've really
gotta say, this one's the finest.
%
Empty as your bottom is dry.
%
This treasure chest is on strike until further
notice.
%
Inside the empty chest is carved:
'Olivier is handsome.'
You briefly wonder if he put that there himself.
%
What happens when you clear out every chest
in the world? What will OTHER adventurers do
then?
%
You begin to suspect that this treasure chest is
a portal to the Meat Dimension.
%
You imagine this chest as it once was,
brimming with treasure and full of delight.
You can hardly bear to look at it now.
%
Well, it's been swell. See you again on New Game+.
%
As you approach, the chest bursts open on its
own! Unfortunately, there's nothing inside.
%
Inside the chest is the key to its heart.
%
You obtain the Sword of the Ancient
God-Kings. Just kidding, it's empty.
%
This chest is empty. You vaguely remember
digging through it and pillaging everything it
had. You can't remember when...
%
No matter where you go or what events you
witness, you can rest easy knowing that this
chest will always be here for you.
%
This chest is as empty as my well of creativity
after writing all of these messages.
%
The chest stares back at you, judging you.
%
I hope you washed your hands if you're going to double-dip.
%
A single tumbleweed rolls from one side of the
chest to another.
%
Yep, it's empty.
%
Oh, boy! You came back to visit me! Does that
mean...you're my first fan?
%
What you have taken from this chest, you
can never restore.
%
Well... Crap.
%
This is the 56th chest you've opened! Congrats!
Nah, just kidding. I'm not even COUNTING.
%
It's a vase! It's a pot! No... It's Super Chest!
%
No matter how desperately you loot, you can't
find anything in the chest. The chest gives
you a smug look, prompting you to scowl back.
%
As you open the chest, a number of trapped,
screaming souls come swirling out.
...That's probably normal.
%
The chest is empty, but at least the interior is
really nice. Velvet-lined and everything!
%
You see a kitten curled up in the chest. Aww...
It's so cute... As a result of acute kittenitis, you
forgot to take whatever else was left inside.
%
You're... You're opening me again? Heeheehee...
How naughty...
%
Check as many times as you want. Nothing will
ever be in here again.
%
Ever notice nobody else is running around
looting these things? Why do you think that is?
%
Look, I know you think it would be wonderful
if we could all just loot infinite amounts of
treasure from the same chest, but no.
%
There's nothing in this chest, but you imagine all
the things that COULD'VE been...
%
Strange. This chest had something BEFORE,
at least...
%
PROTIP: You can hide the body in an empty
chest. I won't tell anyone what you did.
%
You look at the chest. The chest looks at you.
You both know that neither of you have anything
left to give. 
%
The only thing worse than people
like you? Are chests like me.
%
The chest is full of hopes,
but you can't seem to take them away.
%
I once heard on the playground that if you check
a certain chest enough, it'll give you all the items
and as much mira as you can hold!
%
Unable to see the bottom of this ostensibly
empty chest, you drop a pebble into it. You don't
hear it hit the bottom. ...Probably best to leave.
%
I knew you'd come back to me someday!
Look, look! This is Chest Jr! Our Chest Jr!
%
Ooooh, you're one of those completionist types,
huh?
%
You try watering the chest to see if
something will sprout, but the only thing
that grows is the smell.
%
<YOU HAVE ACTIVATED THE STARING CONTEST>
%
You've already looted this chest. You might
have might havesic forgotten, but don't think you
can just come waltzing back and apologize.
%
You wonder if you could use arts to turn this
chest into a small, wooden bathtub. Water would
probably fine. Fire to heat it, likely not.
%
Orbmints: Keeping your breath fresher, longer.
%
As you look into the darkness of the empty
chest, it reminds you of the darkness that fills
your heart.
%
I gave you everything I had to give, and yet...
%
The empty chest's shape tempts you to climb on
top of it and start writing the next great Zemurian
novel. You somehow resist the urge.
%
Sorry, kid. I'm retired.
%
Back again, are we?
%
What if our universe is a chest in someone ELSE's
universe, and someone's going to open us up,
take everything, and just keep coming back?
%
You know this chest is empty, so why do you do
this to yourself? Why do you keep hoping?
%
I know it's not much fun to open an empty chest,
but think about how much fun it was to open
when it still had something in it! Ah, memories.
%
You find a whole bunch of caterpillars. They're
crawly and gross. But they'll grow up into
butterflies! Or moths. Moths are kinda gross, too...
%
The chest is empty now. So empty. So lonely.
Please, don't go.
%
This chest is holding a beauty pageant with all its
other treasure chest friends. But beauty on the
outside can't save how empty it is on inside.
%
No freebies here, I'm afraid.
%
Emptiness, as far as the eye can see.
%
Back in the good ol' days, this required KEYS to
open!
%
This treasure is actually still full of treasure.
Problem is, the rest of the monsters are on break.
Sorry, kid.
%
You open the chest and wait for an item to
levitate from the chest and into your hands.
Nothing happens.
%
As you close the empty chest, you weigh the
pluses and minuses of staying in there to jump
out scare the next person who checks it.
%
You're not diggin this 'One item per chest'
thing, are you?
%
The empty chest's shape tempts you to climb on
top of it and start writing the next great Zemurian
novel. You somehow resist the urge.
%
I... I GUESS you can keep it...
%
Even though there wasn't anything in the chest,
opening it showed you in confetti! Yay!
%
Looking into yet another empty chest, you
wonder who leaves all of these lying around
unclocked.
%
This is empty. Not even half-empty,
just plain empty.
%
Any chance you could put that back where
you found it?
%
There was an item here. It's gone now.
%
We're sorry; The fairies haven't restocked
this chest yet. Please come visit again soon.
%
You gaze into the empty black void of the chest
and, for a fleeting moment, feel very small.
%
Who hides their valuables in chests out in the
open? This is supposed to be a modern nation,
y'know!
%
You see a heart carved around 'Adol + Dogi.'
Where did this chest COME from?
%
HA-HA! YOU THOUGHT TAKING THAT WOULD
MAKE ME WEAK, BUT YOU'VE ONLY AWAKENED
MY TRUE POWER!
%
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me. 𝅘𝅥𝅮
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you... 𝅘𝅥𝅮
%
So... what really stops you from wearing more
than two accessories? Social decorum?
%
You open the chest, ponder putting the item you
took from it back, and close it again with a soft
smile.
%
All of this chest's worldly possessions now
reside within your pack. Unless you sold
them. You didn't SELL them, did you?
%
You obtain 80,000,000 imaginary mira.
%
How many years has this treasure chest been
here? How many adventurers has this chest seen?
You aren't the first, and you won't be the last.
%
FUN FACT: That didn't belong to you.
%
You tip the lid back and thrust your hand
into the chest. Your hand hits the bottom of the
chest and you skin your knuckles.
%
This chest has already given you everything it
had in support of your noble cause. You would
be remiss to ask any more of it.
%
Every empty chest we open takes a little bit of my
soul with it. Soon, I, too, will be empty. 
%
You find a message scratched along the
bottom: 'Loot this chest and do your worst.
But be warned, for ye be cursed.'
%
For every extra item you take from a treasure
chest, a creepy sheep is sheared.
%
You open a chest to find a bandanaed man
hiding inside! Just kidding, it's empty.
%
For sale: Reviving Balm, never used.
%
You open the chest to find hundreds of hissing
snakes and immediately close it again. Good
thing you already got whatever item was in there.
%
The chest unleashes a poison gas trap!
...At least it would if it could. Because you
looted it already, and it hates you now.
%
You don't find anything this time, but maybe if
you kept on opening and closing this one chest
over and over again... (Don't actually do this.)
%
Wear good shoes and you'll never see de feet.
%
I waited four years for this game and all I got
was this stupid chest message.
%
As payment for taking my stuff, you must cut down
the tallest tree in the forest...with...A HERRING!
%
The chest flipped its latch at you.
You get the feeling that it's not a friendly gesture.
%
As you open the treasure chest, you realize that
coming back for more is probably selfish.
You decide to leave what remains to others.
%
You open the chest to the familiar sight of
nothing. Oh, how you've missed this!
%
As you close the chest, it gives you a sad look.
It wishes it had something more for you, too.
%
What? There's nothing in here? BOOO-RIIING.
%
The chest is empty, but if you keep opening and
closing the lid, it looks like it's talking!
%
Looking deep into the back of the chest, you
see a tiny handwritten note that you didn't
notice previously. It reads, 'Please do not take.'
%
This chest is better than others. Why?
Secret. But we'll tell you if you put what you
took back inside.
%
The chest is empty. Why don't you fill it with
something? C'mon. Come right in...
%
Wow... You're the first human to ever take
something from me! I'm so excited! 
%
<YOU HAVE ACTIVATED THE STARING CONTEST>
%
I hate to tell you this, but you've already cleaned
this one out.
%
This chest is empty as you suspected it would
be.
%
I hate to tell you this, but you've already cleaned
this one out.
%
Inside the chest is emptiness. That's all there
ever is. Eternal and interminable.
%
As you open the treasure chest, you realize that
coming back for more is probably selfish.
You decide to leave what remains to other.
%
The chest is empty. You screams of
dissapointment resound off of its wooden walls.
%
Look, I'm a chest and you're a human.
Our love can never be. Let it go.
%
A small spider skitters from one side of the empty
chest to the other. It's actually kind of cute...
%
Sorry, I'm empty.
%
This chest looks sad and deflated now that
you've taken all its stuff.
%
As you open the box again, you think about what
it would be like if you live inside it like a little
house. It'd be cramped, but quaint.
%
You found the greates treasure of all: Friendship.
%
YOU might look at this chest and think itssic empty,
but that's just negative thinking. Others see this
baby and marvel at the amazing air inside.
%
Looking deep into the back of the chest, you
see a tiny, handwritten note that you didn't
notice previously. It reads, 'Please do not take.'
%
Oh, no, it's a Mimic! Prepare for battle!
...Wait. No? False alarm.
%
No freebies here, I'm afraid.
%
There's nothing on the chest but your failed
hopes and dreams for more loot.
%
FUN FACT: That didn't belong to you.
%
You obtain 80,000,000 imaginary mira.
%
You find a message scratched along the
bottom: 'Loot this chest and do your worst.
But be warned, for ye be cursed.'
%
Excuse me, that wasn't meant for you. Put it back!
%
Well... Crap.
%
You obtain the Emperor's New Clothes. Not.
%
It's empty. It wouldn't be in this predicament if
someone hadn't TAKEN WHAT WAS INSIDE.
%
Nothing in here but dust. Lots of dust, actually.
And a nasty smell. Wait, this chest isn't a tiny
coffin, is it?!
%
After minutes of frantic searching, you close
the lid, panting heavily. It's time to admit you
have a problem.
%
It's empty, but you notice a little hole in the
back of the box. The view from there isn't
too bad, either!
%
Oh, hey, is there still something in here? ...Nope.
%
The chest yawns open as if to swallow you into
its infinite emptiness.
%
This is what your curiosity gets you.
%
Were you hoping somebody would come along
and put in MORE stuff for you to take? 
%
Excuse me, that wasn't meant for you. Put it back!
%
Inside the chest is emptiness. That's all there ever
is. Eternal and interminable.
%
You got away with running your hands down
this random chest once. Don't push your luck.
%
Wow, could you at least ASK before opening me?
%
This chest's contents have already gone on
to a better place: your pockets.
%
You found a fine layer of dust!
%
You obtain the Emperor's New Clothes. Not.
%
Was returning here another...BRIGHT IDEA?
%
When you gaze long enough into the empty
chest, the chest gazes back into you.
%
Unable to see the bottom of this ostensibly
empty chest, you drop a pebble into it. You don't
hear it hit the bottom. ...Probably best to leave.
%
Aw, man! Nothing AGAIN? Geez.
%
This chest is as empty as my well of creativity
after writing all of these messages.
%
You scour every square inch of this chest's
empty innards, desperate to find any scrap of
treasure you missed.
%
Ever notice nobody else is running around
looting these things? Why do you think that is?
%
It's empty, but if you planted a seed and kept
coming back to water it, you might be able to
grow a potato or something.
%
Somewhere, deep down in the last pulsing
remnants of your soul, you know you're a
monster.
%
Oh, sure. Just take it! My name's Erik, by the
way. I bet asking my name never even crossed
your mind, did it?
%
You know the chest is empty, but it has
served you well. Instead of opening it, you give
it a gentle pat on the head.
%
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
%
There's nothing in this chest, but sometimes it's
good to pretend.
%
Sorry, I'm empty.
%
This chest is better than others. Why?
Secret. But we'll tell you if you put what you
took back inside.
%
There's nothing in the chest but spiders now.
They all stare at you and clap. Bravo.
%
You're not diggin this 'One item per chest'
thing, are you?
%
Now, now. You know the rules.
%
You find a skeleton wearing a nametag
reading 'M.T. Chester.' Sorry, that was a lie.
You don't find anything.
%
PROTIP: You can hide the body in an empty
chest. I won't tell anyone what you did.
%
You got away with running your hands down
this random chest once. Don't push your luck.
%
When you stare too long into the chest, the chest
stares back at you.
%
You took a gamble on something being in this
chest, and I'm afraid you lost.
%
Wow! Look at all this air!
%
The truth is, there's only one treasure chest in
this entire world. It just follows you around, filling
itself with new goods for you to plunder.
%
Did you hear about the girl who paid for
everything with black sepith crystals? She said it
was only costing her time!
%
This chest is empty.
...No, seriously. It's really empty.
%
I'm alive...and I'm hungry... Feeeeed meee...
%
Inside is a single piece of paper. It's a teaser for
a brand new game called 'Trails in the Chest.'
It looks boring. You put the paper down and leave.
%
You obtain...NOTHING! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
%
You don't understand how hard it is to come up
with five hundred unique treasure chest phrases
that are brimming with sarcasm.
%
Do you remember the last time you opened
this chest? The chest remembers...
%
You open the chest and wait for an item to
levitate from the chest and into your hands.
Nothing happens.
%
Why did you have to come back? You could've
just walked away with the goods, but now the
treasure chest has you right where it wants you!
%
You sit down in the empty chest. You feel safe
here. Conscious that you're being stared at, you
crawl out, sheepishly.
%
You find a skeleton wearing a nametag
reading 'M.T. Chester.' Sorry, that was a lie.
You don't find anything.
%
How many years does it take for a story of heroes
to become a legend of heroes, anyway?
%
It's empty, obviously. Probably should have
thought this one through...
%
Sure, that chest LOOKS nice enough, but you
wouldn't want to get on its bad side. Especially
with your hand inside of it.
%
Inside the chest is a tear in the fabric of reality.
DON'T poke at it.
%
Remember the stuff you took from here last time?
Yeah, the chest was TRYING to afford chest college.
Guess it has to start over again...
%
You open the empty chest open again and again,
cackling manically to yourself. You KNOW it
contains some secret. It just has to!
%
As you open this already-empty chest,
its hinges pinch you in revenge.
%
You kick the chest open, but all you get for your
talented footwork is a stubbed toe. Ow.
%
This chest may not have anything in the way of
riches or possessions, but it's filled to the brim
with hope for the future and love for the world.
%
Let's take all the typos we accidentally left in
this game at launch and shove them all in here.
Pretend they never happened.
%
You sneakily crack the lid of the chest and take
a peek inside. Sadly, no treasure chest fairies
flying around in there. No items, either.
%
The last time I saw something this empty, I was
looking at my calendar. Ahahahaha... *sigh*
%
There was an item here. It's gone now.
%
If you read this, the clowns have won.
%
Oh, hey, is there still something in here? ...Nope.
%
No.
%
This chest's contents have already gone on
to a better place: your pockets.
%
Take, take, take, that's all you ever do!
Why not try giving BACK to an empty chest
sometime?
%
An empty treasure chest. Full of promise
yet devoid of payoff. A perfect metaphor for me.
%
Nothing in here. Good. We don't want people
refilling these while we're not looking.
%
Ugh... Must we go through this AGAIN?
%
You rest your head atop the empty chest.
You rapidly withdraw as you hear what sounds
like a heartbeat.
%
They all look the same to you now. Every one
of them, so helpless, so vulnerable--a mere
target for you and your insatiable hunger.
%
I've been waiting for this day!
%
You look under the chest, hoping to find the
keys to a BRAND NEW AIRSHIP! ...You don't find
anything.
%
There's nothing in the chest but spiders now.
They all stare at you and clap. Bravo.
%
This treasure chest graduated at the top of its
class at the Riches Royal Academy.
%
No.
%
It's empty, but if you planted a seed and kept
coming back to water it, you might be able to
grow a potato or something.
%
Psychically sensing that there's nothing inside,
you walk away from the chest without disturbing
it.
%
I... I GUESS you can keep it...
%
If you're reading this, please send help.
We've been stuck on this game for years... -Loc Team
%
This chest remembers your previous visit and is
none too happy to see you return.
%
I dunno what you expected...
%
There's nothing in the chest. You briefly
wonder if you could use it as a makeshift
boat... 
%
In the dust, you can faintly make out the imprint
of whatever was in here previously.
%
Did you hear about the girl who paid for
everything with black sepith crystals? She said it
was only costing her time!
%
This chest's proud possessions have already
passed to some wandering adventurer's
satchel. Probably yours.
%
The chest's empty, but if you keep opening and
closing the lid, it looks like it's talking!
%
There's nothing in the chest. You briefly
wonder if you could use it as a makeshift
boat...
%
Now that all my contents are gone I feel so lost.
What's my purpose? Why am I here? Who am I?!
%
The chest is empty. And if it could eat you, it
would.
%
All of this chest's worldly possessions now
reside within your pack. Unless you sold
them. You didn't SELL them, did you?
%
As you search the empty chest's insides,
just in case you missed something last time,
it gives you a splinter.
%
This chest is as empty as your soul.
%
You sneakily crack the lid of the chest and take
a peek inside. Sadly, no treasure chest fairies
flying around in there. No items, either.
%
Watch out! There's been somebody going around
looting all my friends, and I think he just got me!
%
I've been looted two games now!
I won't stand for this much longer!
%
Sorry, but I'm cutting you off.
%
Somewhere, deep down in the last pulsing
remnants of your soul, you know you're a
monster.
%
This chest is as empty as that promise you
made. You know which one.
%
Nothing in here. Good. We don't want people
refilling these while we're not looking.
%
You lift the chest over your head and shake as
hard as you can, but nothing comes out. Well,
it was an impressive display of strength, at least.
%
I've been looted so many times that I'm thinking of putting
in a request to the Bracer Guild to catch the culprits. 
%
No matter where you go in this life, there's
always someone looking to take you for all you've
got. It happened to me, and it WILL happen to you.
%
I know it's not much fun to open an empty chest,
but think about how much fun it was to open
when it still had something in it! Ah, memories.
%
I dunno what you expected...
%
As you look into the darkness of the empty
chest, it reminds you of the darkness that fills
your heart.
%
This chest remembers your previous visit and is
none too happy to see you return.
%
It's a vase! It's a pot! No... It's Super Chest!
%
There's nothing in this chest, but you looked so
excited to open it that I didn't have the heart to
tell you earlier.
%
Were you hoping somebody would come along
and put in MORE stuff for you to take?
%
Wear good shoes and you'll never see de feet.
%
You don't understand how hard it is to come up
with five hundred unique treasure chest phrases
that are brimming with sarcasm.
%
...Say, haven't we met before?
%
You've already looted this chest right down to
the bare bottom.
%
Not exactly shy, are you?
%
Let's form a pact. Infinite treasure in exchange...
for your LIFE.
%
You found a fine layer of dust!
%
For every extra item you take from a treasure
chest, a creepy sheep is sheared.
%
Everything that mattered in here is gone.
%
You begin to suspect that this treasure chest is
a portal to the Meat Dimension.
%
Orbmints: Keeping your breath fresher, longer.
%
Was returning here another...BRIGHT IDEA?
%
You flip open the lid, knowing full well you won't
find anything. You're still somehow disappointed
by the result.
%
Returning to a chest you just looted is
kinda like dumpster diving, you know...
%
YOU might look at this chest and think itssic empty,
but that's just negative thinking. Others see this
baby and marvel at the amazing air inside.
%
This empty chest is a monument to your
reckless greed.
%
Someone's robbed this chest blind. Not to
worry. You're on the case.
%
You find only a bleak, empty void.
%
You open the chest, eyes wild with avarice.
Your face falls as you realize you've already
taken everything.
%
A single tumbleweed rolls from one side of the
chest to another.
%
Space for rent. -Management
%
As you reach into the chest, the lid suddenly
snaps down! IT'S EATING YOU ALIVE. ...Kidding!
Oh, you should've seen the look on your face!
%
You look under the chest, hoping to find the
keys to a BRAND NEW AIRSHIP! ...You don't find
anything.
%
You kick the chest open, but all you get for your
talented footwork is a stubbed toe. Ow.
%
They all look the same to you now. Every one
of them, so helpless, so vulnerable--a mere
target for you and your insatiable hunger.
%
This chest is as empty as your soul.
%
You see a single tear roll down its treasure chest
cheek. Wait a second... Chests don't have tear
ducts...
%
Is this your way of asking me out on a date?
%
The empty chest's stomach gurgles.
%
Every empty chest we open takes a little bit of my
soul with it. Soon, I, too, will be empty.
%
TO BE CONTINUED.
%
Well, I see you're not above asking for seconds.
%
This treasure chest graduated at the top of its
class at the Riches Royal Academy.
%
The more you stare, the emptier it seems.
%
The chest is now filled with shame.
The shame of a double-dipper.
%
You open the empty chest open again and again,
cackling manically to yourself. You KNOW it
contains some secret. It just has to! 
%
I suppose I didn't NEED that, but I mean, you
could have asked first.
%
The weight of the chest's lid causes it to shear
off of its old hinges. Awkwardly, you put the lid
back on and try to pretend nothing happened.
%
You've already looted this chest. You might
have might havesic forgotten, but don't think you
can just come waltzing back and apologize.
%
As you close the empty chest, you weigh the
pluses and minuses of staying in there to jump
out scare the next person who checks it.
%
Inside the chest, you find a tiny frog. You tap him
on the head and he happily jumps away. Cute!
%
You open the chest and see something you didn't
notice the first time around. Without warning, the
chest slams itself shut. You cannot open it again.
%
Which of your party members blocks entrances
the best? AGATE!
%
I once heard on the playground that if you check
a certain chest enough, it'll give you all the items
and as much mira as you can hold!
%
This chest is as empty as your soul.
%
The last time I saw something this empty, I was
looking at my calendar. Ahahahaha... *sigh*
%
This chest is empty as you suspected it would
be.
%
BREAKING NEWS! There is nothing in this chest.
More at eleven.
%
My cousin told me about you!
You're a MONSTER!
%
The empty chest opens with a groan. I guess it's
tired of being opened over and over.
%
I wish I could tell you this was full of items again.
But, no. It's empty.
%
Kyaaaaaaaaaaa~
Without my contents I'm...bare!
%
There's nothing in here, but wouldn't it be cool
if there were?
%
In the dust, you can faintly make out the imprint
of whatever was in here previously.
%
Nothing in here but the handprint of whoever
took what was inside. ...Hey, your hand looks
familiar...
%
You've already taken everything this chest
ever had. Have you come back to gloat?
%
The chest is empty. Nothing else will appear here.
Just what kind of game do you think this is?
%
Dang, you REALLY like reading these messages,
don't you?
%
Let me give it to you straight: the chest is empty.
%
You have returned. The pact is sealed.
Your first born child is mine.
%
Nooo! Give it back! That was my spleen!
%
Everything that mattered in here is gone.
%
There's nothing in this chest, but you looked so
excited to open it that I didn't have the heart to
tell you earlier.
%
You open the chest to find a message scrawled
in blood along the underside of the lid:
'WHOEVER TOOK MY STUFF WILL PAY.' Huh.
%
You find only a bleak, empty void.
%
You open the chest, realize you already looted it,
then angrily slam the lid back down.
%
Nothing but nothing.
%
There is nothing in the chest. NOTHING.
Now shoo. Shoo!
%
Sure, it's empty now, but maybe if you
checked it again...
%
You see a single tear roll down its treasure chest
cheek. Wait a second... Chests don't have tear
ducts...
%
As you search the empty chest's insides,
just in case you missed something last time,
it gives you a splinter.
%
You lift the chest over your head and shake as
hard as you can, but nothing comes out. Well,
it was an impressive display of strength, at least.
%
This chest is empty. Not even half-empty,
just plain empty.
%
Did you know that this treasure chest is an
S-rank bracer? Yes, treasure chests have their
own Bracer Guild. And this chest is legendary.
%
There's nothing in the chest, but the air
inside is strangely...humid.
%
When you stare too long into the chest, the chest
stares back at you.
%
The chest is angry at being robbed.
It demands you build it a shrubbery!
%
This chest is as empty as your soul.
%
As you crack the lid of the chest, you hear a
sound like the collective wailing of editors. You
let the lid drop, sealing the sound away forever.
%
You tell the chest to 'say aaah,' and it obliges.
Everything seems to be in order here!
%
I don't think there's an "open every chest in
the game" trophy, but even if there were,
you've already opened this one.
%
If you want something else, you're going to have
to sign this legally-binding contract.
%
You took a gamble on something being in this
chest, and I'm afraid you lost.
%
I wish you a wonderful day full of treasure chest
plundering.
%
The empty chest's stomach gurgles.
%
This chest's proud possessions have already
passed to some wandering adventurer's
satchel. Probably yours.
%
You've already looted this chest right down to
the bare bottom.
%
Watch out! This chest has nothing to lose!
There's no telling what it might do!
%
Not exactly shy, are you?
%
I'm not so sure you understand the definition of
'empty'...
%
Look, I know I don't have anything, but we can
still hang out, right? Wait, come baaaaaaack!
%
You briefly wonder how many jelly beans you
could fit in a treasure chest of this size.
%
Well, hello! Welcome to Treasure Chest Village.
You sure are a funny looking treasure chest...
%
If this chest could talk, it would say, 'You took my
stuff already.'
%
What were you expecting to find here?
%
The chest is but an empty husk now. Do not
mourn, for it is the fate of all things.
%
TREASURE CHEST ADVERTISING FOR THE LOW,
LOW PRICE OF 900 MIRA PER MONTH.
%
Empty. But THAT should come as no surprise.
%
You scour every square inch of this chest's
empty innards, desperate to find any scrap of
treasure you missed.
%
As you try to open the empty chest, you break
part of the corner off. Hoping nobody notices,
you put the piece down and briskly walk away..
%
Whatever riches once lay in this chest,
it's just an empty vessel now.
%
As you open the empty chest, it creaks loudly,
probably cursing you out in its native tongue.
%
Mnhh... Five more minutes...
%
This chest seems happy to see you again.
%
This chest is out of service.
Please come back during business hours.
%
Back for seconds? Have you even used what you
got the first time?
%
Take, take, take, that's all you ever do!
Why not try giving BACK to an empty chest
sometime?
%
At this point, you need to think outside the box.
%
The chest was more than excited to speak with
you. It watched in stunned silence as you simply
opened its lid, shook your head, and walked away.
%
Pawing around at the bottom of the chest,
you find a small door. Opening it, you see...
the ground. Well, that was underwhelming.
%
A cube has six faces, but none of them look as
disappointed as yours does right now.
%
Dogi the Wall Crusher's got nothing on Estelle
the Treasure Taker.
%
This chest is as empty as that promise you
made. You know which one.
%
There's this great story I want to Estell you
sometime.
%
Lamenting the lack of items in the chest, you
ponder the merits of wearing the chest itself as
makeshift armor.
%
Once you notice that this treasure chest is
slowly protruding its sharp fangs from the edges
of its lid, you back away slowly and run.
%
Life is what happens between opening treasure
chests.
%
No matter where you go or what events you
witness, you can rest easy knowing that this
chest will always be here for you.
%
When you think about it, aren't we all a little
empty inside?
%
You open the chest, eyes wild with avarice.
Your face falls as you realize you've already
taken everything.
%
Well, I see you're not above asking for seconds.
%
As you look into the woodgrain of the empty
chest, you wonder how many chests could be
made out of a single tree.
%
This chest is empty...or is that just what it wants
you to think?
%
The chest is empty, but you briefly consider
taking it along with you and selling it to
someone.
%
Wow! Look at all this air!
%
Someone's robbed this chest blind. Not to
worry. You're on the case.
%
Now that you've taken my contents,
this means we're dating, right?
%
This empty chest is a monument to your
reckless greed.
%
You ever wonder if the items in these chests
were meant for someone specific? And you have
the nerve to take them anyway. How rude.
%
Any chance you could put that back where
you found it?
%
Mind doing me a favor and not opening me up
again?
%
Think you can just take my stuff and run off?
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
%
Even though there wasn't anything in the chest,
opening it showed you in confetti! Yay!
%
You open the chest so quickly that it catches
fire, scorching its contents to ashes. Maybe
this'll teach you to contain your excitement!
%
No matter where you go in this life, there's
always someone looking to take you for all you've
got. It happened to me, and it WILL happen to you.
%
Hoping against hope the chest will be full of
goodies again, you slowly raise the lid. Nope.
%
I wish I could Schera little love with you.
%
It's empty now, but don't worry. Whoever put
that item in here probably wanted you to have
it anyway.
%
As you close the lid on yet another empty
treasure chest, you wonder if the locks are only
decorative.
%
This chest is empty. With its lid wide open,
it almost looks like it's screaming at you.
%
You flip the chest upside down and open it, hoping
to open a secret subsection yet to be looted.
You find nothing, and now your arms are tired.
%
The chest is empty. And if it could eat you, it
would.
%
Looking for more treasure? Just what kind of
budget do you think this game had?
%
You've already looted this chest. You briefly
pause to wonder if that's legal.
%
TO BE CONTINUED.
%
Despite your repeated searches, this chest
does not contain any invisible items. In fact,
it doesn't contain anything, visible or otherwise.
%
You've looted this chest already.
It's strange...it almost feels heavier now. 
%
THIS SPACE FOR RENT.
%
Is this your way of asking me out on a date?
%
You look mighty familiar...
Didn't we meet last game?
%
Don't flip your lid...flip mine.
%
Sorry, but I'm cutting you off.
%
You nearly tear the top of the chest of its
hinges in your excitement to open it. Your face
falls as you realize there's nothing inside.
%
As you reach into the chest, the lid suddenly
snaps down! IT'S EATING YOU ALIVE. ...Kidding!
Oh, you should've seen the look on your face!
%
You can save the world, but you can't remember
whether you've looted a chest once or not?
%
It's empty, but if you put your head in here, you
can hear the ocean!
%
Wow... You're the first human to ever take
something from me! I'm so excited!
%
Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer? Ja!
Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!
%
The chest applauds your dedication to larceny.
%
The chest wants to know what it's done
to deserve such treatment.
%
The looters in Calvard aren't this desperate...
%
Nooo! Give it back! That was my spleen!
%
GET A SILK BAG FROM THE GRAVEYARD DUCK TO LOOT
LONGER.
%
Empty. But THAT should come as no surprise.
%
Let's take all the typos we accidentally left in
this game at launch and shove them all in here.
Pretend they never happened.
%
You obtain...NOTHING! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
%
Hey, I know you had high hopes for this chest,
but it's empty. Don't worry about it, though!
Maybe the next one will have something great.
%
The chest sure is empty. Yep.
%
I'm sorry, did you misunderstand something?
Only one item per person. Now go away.
%
I'M SO GLAD YOU CHECKED THIS CHEST. I'm you,
from the future, and I came back in time and
worked on this game so I could warn you about--
%
The chest is empty, but the woodwork is
impressive!
%
How would you like it if some random chest
kept opening you?
%
You open the chest to see a man's face
just smiling at you. Unsettled, you back away
and close the lid. Let's not open that one again.
%
Hey, you. Yeah, you. Stop reading all these chest
messages and get on with playing the game!
%
At the bottom of the chest you find only crumbs.
Briefly wondering how long a chest like this
would keep food fresh for, you walk away.
%
Despite your repeated searches, this chest
does not contain any invisible items. In fact,
it doesn't contain anything, visible or otherwise.
%
Oh, no, not again...
%
You came back! *BLUSH*
%
Somewhere out there is a person who started
playing Trails in the Sky Second Chapter before
the first game. I bet they're very confused.
%
Could just be your imagination, but...it's empty.
%
This chest is empty. You looted it already.
This is a haiku.
%
Sorry, better luck next time.
%
Disappointed by the lack of treasure, you briefly
consider carving a heart and some initials into
the chest. But whose?
%
You flip open the lid, knowing full well you won't
find anything. You're still somehow disappointed
by the result.
%
Looks like another open-and-shut case!
%
Nya-ha! Made you look!
%
The chest is empty. You're struck by the urge
to climb inside and take a nap.
%
Back in the good ol' days, this required KEYS to
open!
%
At the bottom of the chest you find only crumbs.
Briefly wondering how long a chest like this
would keep food fresh for, you walk away.
%
As you turn away from the empty chest, you hear
a strange and ominous hissing.
%
E to the M to the P-T-Y.
%
Running your hands along the bottom of the
chest, you obtain a splinter!
%
Thinking you've come back to return its stuff,
the chest opens wide in anticipation. As you
leave, it closes with a pained, awkward creak.
%
I had saved some coffee for you, but then it was
taken in a mugging.
%
Nothing in here but a couple of hairs. Gross...
%
How would you like it if some random chest
kept opening you?
%
I'll have you know that if you could take
multiple items from the same chest, the
economy would collapse.
%
Nothing. Well, life is full of little disappointments.
%
Oh, no, it's a Mimic! Prepare for battle!
...Wait. No? False alarm.
%
What you have taken from this chest, you
can never restore.
%
As you open the chest, a number of trapped,
screaming souls come swirling out.
...That's probably normal.
%
The chest is empty. You screams of
dissapointment resound off of its wooden walls.
%
Looks like another open-and-shut case!
%
Sorry, better luck next time.
%
There's nothing in the chest but spiders now.
They all stare at you and clap. Bravo.
%
I had saved some coffee for you, but then it was
taken in a mugging.
%
The chest is pleased that you have returned.
You can be its friends. Its special 'awake' friend.
%
You gaze into the empty black void of the chest
and, for a fleeting moment, feel very small.
%
Remember the stuff you took from here last time?
Yeah, the chest was TRYING to afford chest college.
Guess it has to start over again...
%
You obtain the Sword of the Ancient
God-Kings. Just kidding, it's empty.
%
You briefly wonder how many jelly beans you
could fit in a treasure chest of this size.
%
You wonder if you could use arts to turn this
chest into a small, wooden bathtub. Water would
probably fine. Fire to heat it, likely not.
%
This chest was once full of wondrous
treasures. Then you came along.
%
Don't flip your lid...flip mine.
%
This chest may not have anything in the way of
riches or possessions, but it's filled to the brim
with hope for the future and love for the world.
%
There's nothing in this chest, but sometimes it's
good to pretend.
%
It's empty, but if you put your head in here, you
can hear the ocean!
%
Ugh... Must we go through this AGAIN?
%
If you can read this...well.
%
You imagine this chest as it once was,
brimming with treasure and full of delight.
You can hardly bear to look at it now.
%
E to the M to the P-T-Y.
%
As you approach, the chest bursts open on its
own! Unfortunately, there's nothing inside.
%
This treasure chest is on strike until further
notice.
%
I waited four years for this game and all I got
was this stupid chest message.
%
There's nothing in this chest, but you imagine all
the things that COULD'VE been...
%
As you look into the woodgrain of the empty
chest, you wonder how many chests could be
made out of a single tree.
%
Inside the empty chest is carved:
'Olivier is handsome.'
You briefly wonder if he put that there himself.
%
Nothing. Well, life is full of little disappointments.
%
Mind doing me a favor and not opening me up
again?
%
Hey, you. Yeah, you. Stop reading all these chest
messages and get on with playing the game!
%
Somewhere out there is a person who started
playing Trails in the Sky Second Chapter before
the first game. I bet they're very confused.
%
Back again? You might be the most desperate
hero I've ever met.
%
BREAKING NEWS! There is nothing in this chest.
More at eleven.
%
An empty treasure chest. Full of promise
yet devoid of payoff. A perfect metaphor for me.
%
There's nothing in the chest, but the air
inside is strangely...humid.
%
We're sorry; The fairies haven't restocked
this chest yet. Please come visit again soon.
%
Hey, I know you had high hopes for this chest,
but it's empty. Don't worry about it, though!
Maybe the next one will have something great. 
%
This chest is empty. You vaguely remember
digging through it and pillaging everything it
had. You can't remember when...
%
Once you notice that this treasure chest is
slowly protruding its sharp fangs from the edges
of its lid, you back away slowly and run. 
%
The treasure chest reveals itself to be a crafty mimic, and licks your
unsuspecting hand. Better break out the disinfectant.
%
The message: Remember, there is but one truth: Love is ETERNAL.
%
Mmm. Pine fresh!
%
We need to talk. 
%
Did you know? It's true that Zin's name was once written as 'Zane', but
another name change considered was Olivier's. The original suggestion
was 'Oliver'. This chest is glad that request never went through.
%
I'm here because they ran out of jokes.
%
A chest, a chest! My kingdom for a chest!
%
Do you really have nothing better to do than open all of us a second time?
%
Don't you hate it when someone opens your door and doesn't close it

Why is Deen called the Spinach Fiend, anyway? Does he just really like
Spinach?
%
You took all my loot. How am I supposed to pay my room and board now?
%
Do you have any idea how old that dish was?
%
You found the greatest gift of all: love.
%
Did you know? The Trails in the Sky games now have a nifty 'Skip S-Craft'
feature on PC. That's not even in the original Japanese version! Isn't that
neato torpedo?

Empty chest? Why not fill it up again at Bose Market? --Maybelle

I hear Olivier makes his pack Mueller carry all of his belongings for him.

I really should have ordered that security orbment from ZCF.
%
A forgotten chest
Despoiled and left behind
Its sad lot in life 
%
My father wanted me to be a cabinet when I grew up. I should have
listened.
%
Sorry, but the magic Pom that restocks all the chests hasn't come by
here yet. Try again in another game.
%
I've been told I have a nice chest.
%
You should treasure every moment.
%
Wait, Father! I haven't finished my confession yet!
%
Well, at least it's not another Abbadon Potluck.
%
If you stare into this chest and say 'Ouroboros' five times, Blueblanc will
visit you this night.
%
You don't understand! I coulda had items. I coulda been a treasure.
I could've been something...instead of empty.
%
You gaze deeply into the empty chest, hoping for enlightenment.
...You feel hungry.
%
Roses are red, violets are blue.
A tear I have just shed, since I've got nothing more for you.
%
Inside the chest is an ancient note hinting at the location of the eighth
Sept-Terrion. It crumbles to dust before you can read it.
%
I'M NOT CLEVER ENOUGH FOR ALL THESE CHEST PHRASES
%
Did you know? Walter the Direwolf's original name is the Lankywolf,
but this isn't quite as---intimidating in English. The name change came
with the original team's blessing.
%
There's some green hair inside. The chest prays to Aidios this sinful
priest gets his just desserts.
%
Forgive this sinful chest, Father, for I have nothing more to give.
%
You are the *real* treasure.
%
You're...not going to kidnap me, are you?
%
I'm empty, you say? What a Liberlous statement!
%
Did you know? Early concepts had Joshua as the protagonist while Estelle
had Joshua's current role. Over time, however, the team believed it made
more sense if the roles were switched.
%
Imagine how much more you'd have earned if you'd left this closed and
let the interest accrue.
%
You'll get not one sepith more from me, you fiend!
%
The chest is empty.
Look, YOU try coming up with hundreds of these across three games.
%
I'm still empty. What were you expecting, a MIRAcle?
%
Hey! My eyes are up here.
%
Pssst... Your survival hinges on what I have to say. Run! Run now!
%
Did you know? Trails in the Sky takes place in Liberl, but there are other
Trails games that take place beyond the kingdom's borders. For example,
Trails of Cold Steel happens in the Erebonian Empire (buy it).
%
Beware! This chest is full of salt.
%
*fart* Oh, my... Excuse me. Heehee.
%
You mean two games full of these cheesy phrases wasn't enough?
%
...Then the other chest told me, 'How many quartz does it take to make a
line?'
%
I WAS ONE DAY AWAY FROM RETIREMENT.
%
Ries-king your life only to run all the way back to an empty chest?
%
So you're back, Rean Quartze--!! Wait. Wrong game.

I had a heart of gold until you STOLE it.

My favorite character is Chester from Ys: The Oath in Felghana.

Didn't you know? Repetition is my favorite form of humor!
Didn't you know? Repetition is my favorite form of humor!
%
There is a 'Beware of Chest' sign. You reach to open the chest anyway
and it tries to bite your hand.
%
Trails in the Sky the 3rd was delayed for five years to come up with more
treasure chest phrases.
%
Have you had a good meal in you? Got your weapons polished? Taken a
bath...? No. No, you haven't taken a bath.
%
In an infinite number of parallel universes, I have more treasure to give
to you. Not in this one, though.

What were you hoping to find? One of the Sept-Terrions?

How many chests could a chest checker check if a chest checker could
check chests?

There's a crab in there. You stole its home. You monster.
%
Hey, Father! I have some new Stregas inside. Would you kindly come in
and try them on?
%
What are you still doing here?! You're a priest, for Aidios' sake!
%
You've really opened me up to new possibilites. 
%
The chest appreciates your concern, but it's doing okay.
%
Did you know? Halle from Gambler Jack's name was originally translated
accurately as 'Haru,' but it turns out that the official Japanese spelling wasn't
that, but 'Halle.' This was revealed in Gambler Jack's sequel.
%
Please do not take without permission. Thank you.
%
Congratulations! It's a girl!
%
Looking into the void inside the empty chest, you start questioning the
nature of life itself.
%
Could ya spare a Tear Balm or two for these rusty hinges?
%
You open the lid. A piercing scream fills the air.
You quickly shut the lid and walk away.
%
*lid creaks* TEN THOUSAND YEARS WILL GIVE YOU SUCH A CRICK IN
THE NECK.
%
It's a shining pom! Wait. That's a lie...like the promise of more treasure.
%
Bet you 50 mira that item is still in your inventory during the final battle.

If this empty chest were filled to the brim with food, it still wouldn't be

Devoid of any treasure.

Mr. Tiddles looks up with an annoyed expression. You disturbed his nap.
%
Empty? No, my friend. I'm filled with artisan-style voidness.
%
(Will write flavor text for food)
%
Don't spend it all in one place! Run along, now!
%
There is nothing left in this chest, mon ami. Am I sure? Tres sure!
%
Congratulations! You're the second adventurer to open this chest! This is
why there's nothing left in it.
%
Judge a dungeon not by the color of its textures, but by the content of
its treasure chests.
%
And I thought letting you rob me would have been enough to get rid of
you...
%
Didn't Sunday school teach you not to steal? I bet you were one of those
kids who slept through lessons...
%
I am content without my contents.
%
Would you also like a coffee? By the way, that was a rhetorical question.
%
Warning: Do not store children or other living creatures in chest.
%
Joke's on you. This treasure wasn't tax deductible.
%
Oh, gosh! I usually only open up to my therapist.
%
Chest will remember that...
%
Ohhh, you found my treasure. What, you want a medal? Perhaps in
another chest.
%
I'm glad I'm not a pirate chest. Those ARRR usually buried underground.
%
I see you enjoy finding empty spaces.
%
Please, save us from these treasure chest messages. We're out of ideas---
%
Give it back! That wasn't yours!
%
Can't even sleep in peace...
%
This chest is empty. And it smells like old people.
%
You know, I'm worth a hell lot more sepith than that lousy trinket you just
took!
%
The aromatic hickory lining of this chest permeated the Sludgy Cookies
with a mouth-watering flavor.
%
You found a plank of wood, but it seems to be nailed down.
%
Not really sure what you expected from me. I'm a box...
%
Say, what year is this? I've lost count...
%
This chest was made with state-of-the-art air freshener technology.
%
The first step towards beating kleptomania is admitting that there's a

Hey again. Wait. Where's that guy you were with before?

There is no greater void than the one between your ears.
%
We'd tell you to have a barrel of fun, but come on. We don't call 'em
treasure BARRELS.
%
I should move to a palace. That way I could be a...court chester.
%
Back for more items? What am I, a shop?
%
After cleaning the inside, you decide to polish the outside as well.
%
This... This is not what it looks like!
%
Your luscious locks of hair are NOTHING compared to my lovely locks of

see any instruments.

This treasure chest was supposed to have a witty saying, but we drew a
Bleublanc.
%
Have you seen those chests from Erebonia? They're the strong, silent type.
%
*hack* *sputter* Sorry, I've got a bit of a chesty cough!
%
We are both empty.
%
You're the sister here. Does 'Thou shall not steal' ring any bells?
%
Empty. Someone must have taken the chest phrase that used to be in here.
%
Don't you have better things to do?
%
Isn't this the part where you give me something in exchange? Y'know...
like a decent human being?
%
I don't see your name on that item, so why are you taking it?
%
Step right up, step right up! Grab your free item today! Not you, sir--
you've already got yours. Leave some for others.
%
Think outside the box. Er, chest.
%
Your excuse for thievery is as wooden as I am.
%
We ran out of ideas for messages, so take this treasure instead.
%
Victim's Memoirs: I ate my friend today. What else was I supposed to do?
I was starving. We both were. And there's no food here. So we decided,
together, that one of us should try to live just a little bit longer.
%
Someone carved a smiley face at the bottom... It was you.
%
I was filled with something once, but now there's nothing. All because of
you.
%
I have some ideas for you but I'm keeping 'em close to my chest, sorry.
%
A spider looks at you angrily for disturbing its living room.
%
Did you know? Trails in the Sky's Japanese name is 'Sora no Kiseki,'
but the Japanese team has fully endorsed the English name to the point
where it's used on the cover of the Sora no Kiseki manga in Japan!
%
The words 'Renne,' 'Rend,' and 'End' combine to make...what, exactly?
Be sure to keep this hint in mind.
%
Did you know? Ein's name was originally translated as 'Anne' in the novel
Carnelia, but this name dropped the meaning to her name, which is 'One'
in German. That's why it's respectfully back to 'Ein' now.
%
You take my stuff, I take your stuff!
%
Be thankful this chest doesn't have teeth.
%
Merchant accidentally dropped me here. Please don't leave me alone!!
%
When I said, 'Give me some space,' this isn't exactly what I had in
mind...
%
It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
%
Tempting. But the chest is too heavy to take with you.
%
You briefly imagine what it would be like to be stuck in a box for
decades, only to be stolen by an adventuring treasure hunter.
%
I rusted shut a long time ago! You must be really working out.
%
Thank you, but your treasure is in another chest.
%
Warning: Chest must be filled past this line in order to operate properly!
%
Hey, there's an echo in here! ...Echo in here... ...Echo in here... ...in here...
%
The chest secretly admires you, but it'll never admit its feelings.
%
The bottom of this chest is a lovely mahogany.
%
People say I lack substance...
%
You got something with your eyes? Because this is the second time
you're checking my contents.
%
I'm locked with a combination that hasn't been used in over a century!
How did you unlock me?
%
What do a shirtless guy and what you're looking at now have in common?
A bare chest.
%
Congratulations. By opening me, you missed out on the best weapon in
the game.
%
Maybe the one who is actually empty is the person double checking
open chests all over the place!
%
You've taken away my one purpose in life.
%
No, you can't return it. You don't even have the receipt!
%
There's some green hair inside. The chest prays to Aidios this sinful
priest gets his just desserts.
%
What if the world you live in is actually a gigantic chest?
%
Isn't it convenient that you always find weapons that someone in your
group specializes in? You're welcome, by the way.
%
I'm telling my mommy on you!
%
They say it's what's on the inside that counts. Now look what you've
done.
%
You see a human skeleton that wasn't in there before.
%
Excuse me! Could you scratch my back, please?
%
You're causing terrible, terrible damage across this kingdom. How does
it feel?
%
Thieving attempt failed! -20 Charisma
%
Kevin briefly considers taking the chest as a new weapon, but it's not
quite bow-y enough.
%
You realize that was in my stomach until just now, right? Yuck!
%
A small plate of windowglass lies on the bottom of the empty box. Alas,
another unexpected chest pane!
%
Nice job, Pandora.
%
If I didn't want to be opened, I would have taken a job as a coffin.
%
Did you hear about the two bracers in high school? They went to Shining
Prom together.
%
ACERBIC TOMATOES ARE PEOPLE
%
My vocal instructor told me I should use my chest voice more...
%
Fine. Take it! I don't even want it anymore!
%
I should have listened to my parents and become a cupboard instead.
%
This chest is empty, but it smells pleasantly minty.
%
Y'know what song I have stuck in my head? Neither do I.
%
This chest contains the meaning of life.
%
This chest is covered with a thick layer of funky-smelling mildew.
But you're gonna wear the Crest Charm anyway, aren't you?
%
Now that I'm empty, have you considered depositing all your mira inside?
%
If only I'd come with an explosive trap...
%
You find a torn note that says: 'chest No. 53 wuz here'
%
I hope you at least made sure to not leave fingerprints on the crime scene.
%
Did you know, the average human body contains enough bones to make
an entire human skeleton?
%
There are mustard stains in this chest.
%
I have a cousin in Erebonia. He doesn't talk much.
%
Give me loot or give me death.
%
Nope. Joshua isn't in here.
%
It's you! It's really you! I'm such a huge fan!! Will you sign my chest?!
%
Look behind you.
%
Hey! I stole this first!
%
Please do not disturb the sleeping mimics.
%
Guess what my favorite tree is? Chestnut! Get it? Hahaha... I hate my life.
%
Were you the one who made me feel empty inside?
%
hash tag treasure chest life
%
A cascade of freshly-hatched spiders pours from the chest.
%
Wood are you looking at?
%
There's a note: 'Beware the carnivorous bookshelf.'
%
This chest has cursed you with the insatiable urge to check all the other
empty chests.
%
Why are you leaving me open? I'm starting to be cold!
%
No worries! I won't tell anyone about your theft. After all, chests do not
speak.
%
I get the feeling we've already met... Say, you got a twin by any chance?
%
If you're going to take all that out, the least you could do is take care of
the dust, too.
%
Have you met my cousin, Chester? Last I heard, he was living a few
dungeons over.
%
Kyaaa! You've seen the most secretive part of my body! It's so
embarrassing!
%
Gary was here
Ash is a loser
%
Don't you know greed is one of the seven deadly sins?
%
Making changes from the Japanese script? How treasureous!
%
When I was told I needed to lose weight, this was not what I had in mind.
%
Anyone need a storage chest? I charge cheap.
%
You think I could use an inner paint job?
%
The eternal abyss mocks you.
%
Oh, why was I born a wooden container?!
%
There was a treasure here. It's gone now.
%
Well, an empty chest is good for sitting and resting. Come, sit down.
Sit down and rest.
%
I hope the next chest locks you up and throws away the key!
%
This chest's interior was professionally decorated.
%
I'll see you in court!
%
If a treasure chest is opened in a forest and there's no adventurer there
to check it, is it still empty?
%
At least buy me dinner first!
%
Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?
%
My brethren warned me of your arrival. You are 'The One Who Checks All
Chests Twice,' yes?
%
By the way, where did you find the key to open me?
%
I have no vocal cords, and I must scream.
%
There is one thing I wanna know at this time: is Oliversic being an idiot again?
%
Mirror, mirror on the wall, where's my loot? Who took it all?
%
Hey! Nice to see you again!
%
I-I... I can't think of anything to say!
%
...But the real treasure is KNOWLEDGE.
%
Inside the chest was absolutely nothing. Nothing after nothing came
bursting out.
%
There's a picture of you looting this treasure chest inside. You decide
to leave it alone.
%
The dust in this chest is centuries old. You feel a very historical sneeze
coming on. 
%
I'm empty now, but when I was younger? Adventurers couldn't keep
their hands off me!
%
So tell me, how effective was that expired medicine?
%
Awesome! Let's chest bump!
%
So I heard you like chests... YOU PERVERT!
%
Do you take joy in yanking out others' insides?
%
If you want it that badly, you could've asked.
%
Sorry, but the legendary item drop is in another chest. 
%
The treasure was you all along!
%
Someone scrawled a limerick on the inside of the chest...oh. OH. Okay.
Wow. That's not gonna pass a T-rating.
%
All that's left at the bottom is the tiny glimmer of hope.
%
Do you know the name of Estelle Bright? The thief without equal. In her
lifetime, she stole many treasures and left behind over a thousand chests.
%
The lock on the front of the chest is just painted on.
%
I have a somewhat unfavorable premonition about this.
%
What makes the chests of Liberl so talkative, anyway? Most other
countries prefer strong, silent chests.
%
You've stolen my treasure...and my heart.
%
Excuse me. I got lost... Can you take me with you?
%
Unfortunately, what you stole from me won't help relieve you of your
kleptomaniac issues.
%
Thanks for lifting that guilt off of me. 
%
Much to Mary and Polly's dismay, this chest is empty as can be. 
%
I hope you find your happy ending.
%
The chest itsic empty...er than it was, like, a second ago.
%
If things seem too difficult and you feel like giving up, take a quick break
and then keep going. You've already made it this far, right?
%
Go on. Get outta here!
%
Maybe I should take a little journey of my own. What do you think?
%
Think I can get a stained glass window installed on me?
%
I hope you took away a lot of happy memories from this.
%
Thank you!
%
You were so patient. Was it worth the wait?
%
No shame in reaching for seconds here! Afraid I'm all out, though.
%
I wonder how many treasure chests have helped you out?
%
...Could it be? A FRIEND?
%
<INSERT>
%
Congratulations! You won our special prize: absolutely nothing.
%
This wasn't easy, but you persevered.
%
My heart is full to bursting with so many wonderful thoughts right now.
%
High five! Down low! ...Oh, no! I don't have hands!
%
*squeak*
%
I see you've found the key...to my heart. *kiss*
%
You'll always be my hero, you know?
%
Thank you for your patronage. Please come again!
%
You're near the end. I'm sure you're strong enough to overcome!
%
Nice to meet you! Let's be friends.
%
Bye-bye. I'll miss you.
%
There's a certain air of royalty about this chest. Maybe this is the chest
king?
%
I hope we can meet again someday.
%
Keep your chin up. The only thing standing in your way is you.
%
Thanks for giving me purpose in life. Best of luck!
%
This has been quite a journey for you, hasn't it?
%
You deserve a win. I'll be right here and cheering you on every step of
the way.
%
The cute chest is empty...but still cute.
%
Until next time, see ya.
%
I love you!
%
No time like the present, right? Go get 'em!
%
Good luck!
%
Trails means the world to me. I'm happy I could share my world with you.
Thank you for giving this wonderful series a chance. -- 'B'
%
I'm normally not one for sappy goodbyes, but man... Who knew a chest
could shed tears?
%
See you, space priestboy...
%
Thanks for saying hello!
%
I used to be an evil chest aboard the Glorious. Thanks for inspiring me.
%
The chest seems displeased.
%
Don't give up, okay?
%
These are the kinds of stories that turn into legends.
%
Promise me we'll meet again!
%
Empty. Oops.
%
The chest seems shy. You give it a modest pat-pat on the top of its lid,
then a quiet giggle in response.
%
The chest glares as if it wants to say, 'You got any special reason for
taking that? It's okay. I'll wait.'
%
All the items here are pretty amazing, aren't they? Use them well.
%
The chest presents to you an invitation to its birthday party.
%
You're almost there! Keep going!
%
You took the time to talk to me even when you're this busy? Heehee.
You're so sweet.
%
I feel blessed to have gotten the chance to work on this series. I feel like
it was a lot of luck to get this chance. -- 'S'
%
I'll pray to Aidios for your success.
%
I'm rooting for you!
%
I hope that item helps!
%
Long time no see! Is that a new haircut?
%
I've never seen so many heroes up close and personal before...
%
Go kick some butt!
%
Do you feel like you're a stronger person now?
%
I only wish I could give more, but you'll have to wait until New Game+.
%
Your friends will always stand by you. When you're happy, they're happy.
And when you're hurt, they'll hurt, too. Try to share all your feelings with
your friends so you can be happy and cry together.
%
I'm really proud of you for making it this far.
%
You're good to go!
%
Thanks for playing these games. My coding fingers are going numb!

The chest is appearssic honored that you have taken its contents.
%
Phew! Thanks. It was getting a little cluttered in here.
%
The chest isn't empty; it's full of hope.
%
Everything good?
%
Keep dreaming of a wonderful future.
%
You're doing it! You're doing it!
%
Nya-go.
%
Not much farther, now!
%
Aww. I had an extra item in here, but you just missed it! 
%
The chest is empty.
%
The chest is empty.
%
The chest is empty.
...Hah! Got you! You thought we forgot, huh?
Hahaha, you should see the look on your face!
%
The chest is empty.
...Or is it?
Yes. Yes it is.
%
The following chest messages were written in an
organic, cage-free environment and sourced locally
from the Geofront.
%
That's not really a Tear Balm, you know.
It's a bottle of my ACTUAL TEARS because
of this blatant theft!
%
You'll take a lost child with you, but not me.
I see how it is.
%
Battle Scopes are one way you can scan enemies for the
Combat Notebook. You should probably get on that, Detective.
%
Attempting luck skill check...
Luck skill check failed.
The chest is still empty.
%
You find fingerprints inside the chest that point to
the likely culprit behind its contents' theft.
Three guesses as to who that is.
%
You're sucked into the chest and end up in a chest-based
world with no way back. Decades go by, your memories of
Crossbell fade, and as your life comes to an end, you take
your final breath...only to wake up. It was all a dream!
%
But FIRST, a word from our sponsors: Orbal VPN!
%
The higher elements appear to be active in this chest...
Unfortunately, there are still no more items.
%
The ventilation here is your biggest fan,
and yet you just go and shut it down! 
%
Wait, you don't live in Villa-Raisins.
Get outta here!
Chapter 3:
Please close my lid. Can't you see how much
confetti I'm collecting?
%
Zzz... Zzz...
(The chest appears to be drooling in its sleep.)
%
No wonder no one trusts the police these days.
They're out here stealing from us treasure chests!
Chapter 3:
Happy birthday, Crossbell! I got these just for you.
Hope they're the right size!
%
...What? I'm not on the clock, so screw off.
They don't pay me enough to make witty
remarks to players using debug.
%
Did you know? The Bell of Crossbell was recovered in S1185, but it was
known of long before researchers relocated it. Its documented history
dates back to the Middle Ages, and it helped inspire the name 'Crossbell.'
Chapter 3:
For the Anniversary Festival, me and some of my buddies
are gonna get together under the Bell of Crossbell and
party like it's 1199!
%
Let's play hide-and-seek. You hide something valuable
in me, and then go seek therapy for your kleptomania.
%
The chest joins your party!
Its MOV is 0, however, so it will wait here.
%
'Hyeh hyeh hyeh!'
(Imelda appears to have left a voice recorder in the chest.)
%
Y'know, I used to contain a bottle of Grand Chardonnay.
I wonder what became of it. Last I heard, it ended up
in Liberl.
%
You check the chest and find this text box.
It is a very good text box, I assure you.
Very well written.
%
Kept you waiting, huh?
Chapter 3:
I tried to go join the festivities, too, but...
I kind of got lost in the B Sector.
%
How'd you even get here? Don't you
have anything better to do?
%
The last thing I want to do is hurt you...
but it's still on the list.
%
I've spent my entire life on top of Revache's factory
and this is STILL the worst crime I've ever witnessed.
%
You didn't earn that and you know it.
%
A treasure chest walked into a bar.
As it was clearly a mimic, it was instantly slaughtered.
Poor thing didn't even get a drink...
%
Whoa, slow your roll there, pal!
You can't even DO the quest that's useful for yet.
%
The real Tio would be disappointed in you.
%
So ya finally figured out how
to get to me, did ya?
%
Damn tourists, always wandering into places they
don't belong... Wait, how ARE you here right now?
%
If I catch you using debug again,
I'm gonna whoop your de-butt. 
%
AHH! Goddess, it hurts! The grass
is clipping right through me!
%
Welcome to the Crossbell Watchtower.
...We don't know what it's for, either.
%
I thought you were supposed to serve the people!
But here you are, helping yourself!
%
The contents of this chest brought to you
by the International Bank of Crossbell.
Visit us for premium sepith exchange rates.
%
It's empty, but the woodwork is amazing!
Is it...chestnut?
%
Can you feel how hard this chest is?
I could bench press your entire party.
%
Sorry. No returns, exchanges, or chest credit.
%
Heaven saw that, you know.
%
Wait a second, you're not Adol!
WHERE AM I?!
%
My buddy's from Liberl and he got his message
written by the original crew of chest writers.
%
Yeah, well, my cousin's Erebonian and
he didn't even GET a message!
%
You are now breathing manually.
That's my revenge for taking that quartz. 
%
Next time, I'm using a lock.
%
Is the chest half-full or half-empty?
Neither. It's completely empty.
%
I always wanted to be a fisherman
but, well... *sob*
%
Don't call me a box! I'm not a box!
My cousin's a box and he's a complete idiot!
%
The chest is empty and exercises its right to remain silent.
%
A bracer robbing a chest, I can understand.
But a cop? That's low, man.
%
Sure, you stole from me, but it's all
water under the bridge now.
%
Growing up, I always wanted to be a dancer...
My father made me take up boxing, though.
%
I hope your pockets are now Lloyded with sepith.
%
I'd put a joke about law enforcement here,
but it'd be a bit of a cop-out.
%
After that string of chest thefts in Liberl, you
would think they'd have some locks installed.
%
There are some...peculiar magazines inside the
chest. You decide to leave them where they are,
despite Randy's protests...
%
Back in my day, we had to work HARD for our
curia balms. And we definitely wouldn't have 99
of them in our second playthrough. No, siree. 
%
You're really going to take that EP Cut 1?
Haven't the Armoricans been through enough? 
%
If the CPD found out who stole from me,
you'd be unempLloyd.
%
As you walk away with a mediocre item, you fail to notice
that the chest itself is made of priceless Zemurian Ore.
%
Did it just get a lot Brighter out here?
%
Thanks, actually. I needed to get that
off my chest.
%
This tree didn't IMPEDE you from seeing me.
%
Amongst chests, it's not what's on the inside
that counts, but what's on the outside.
%
If that's Stargazer's Tower, does this
make me Towergazer's Chest?
%
Y'know, I used to work at St. Ursula's Medical College
for a bit, but I quit because I couldn't stand their uniforms.
They were just so tight around the chest.
%
Haven't you checked your workout schedule?
Today's leg day, not chest day!
%
In a flash of entrepreneurial inspiration, you decide
to pin a notice to the chest:
'For rent. Newly renovated interior. 200 mira/month.'
%
Oh, great. I'm going to stay like this forever, aren't I?
%
How about you do your job and actually arrest
someone for once? Yourselves, in this case. 
%
Tell you what. If you promise you'll never open
another chest again, I'll forgive you for this one.
%
You find a notebook with a gauntlet on it. You
decide to leave it in case the owner comes back.
%
Heh. I'm giving you that for free 'cause I know
before long, you'll come crawlin' back for more.
%
It is unbecoming for a law enforcer to be this greedy.
You lose 15 DP.
%
Chest messaging rates may apply.
%
Inside the chest, you discover the secret city of Chestbell.
%
Inside the chest, you find a big goose egg.
%
You took everything from me... Everything!
...
Well, at least I still have my charming personality.
%
Help! I'm careening off of a cliff!
I think my S-Brakes were cut!
%
I had hoped that Phantom Thief B would be the one to
loot me. I guess I'm not beautiful enough. *whimper*
%
Your investigation into the theft of this chest comes
up empty, much like the chest itself. You conveniently
ignore the fact that you are the thief.
%
Did you cheat to get this chest message? Hmm, no,
probably not. I bet you're just reading this from the
database, huh? 
%
Don't let the spelling fool you into thinking this place
didn't actually name itself 'Mines Mining Village.'
%
Ah HA! I'm actually an undercover chest
working for the Chest Police Department.
You're busted, buster!
%
The real treasure is buried underneath, but
you'll never be able to move me! NEVER!
%
Dammit, rookie! I've been working undercover as
a chest for 12 years and you just blew everything!
%
Did you hear about the woman who
had a craving for goldia sepith?
She just wanted some space, man.
%
I'm not empty. I'm making a statement.
%
Mine your own business.
%
Your request for a rare, ultra powered quartz from
before the Septian Calendar is being processed.
Please stand by.
%
I'll let you in on a little secret. There was more than
one item in here, but someone beat you to it and
took the good stuff. The bad stuff? You're holding it.
%
Annoyed at having to check every treasure chest twice?
You should treasure these chest messages while you can.
After all, one day, they might not be there anymore...
%
Just think. If you spent less time harassing chests,
you could have already finished this support request.
%
You peer deep inside the chest once again,
only to bump your head against the lid as
you stand back up. Serves you right. 
%
Made you look.
...Well, actually, three games worth of expectations
made you look, but I'm still taking credit.
%
A note inside of the treasure chest reads:
'I already have 99, so you guys take this one.
- Estelle'
%
Don't worry. I'll restock in time for New Game Plus.
%
Can you close my lid? I don't want a bird to
build a nest inside me or something.
%
You're from the city? Do you know my pal, Lyd?
He comes by all the time to watch the trains.
%
Does the phrase 'unlawful search and seizure'
ring any bells for you?
%
Someone should EP Charge you with theft.
%
Mya~uun.
Nya~on.
%
You look back in the chest, thinking you might have
missed something, and find a tiny bearded man
in a pointy hat doing a little dance.
%
The true result of the Non-Aggression Pact is not
technological exchange, but the spread of talkative
treasure chests previously native to Liberl.
%
Disappointed with the chest's lack of contents, you close it.
One could call this...an open-and-shut case.
%
I'm on the highway to BELL(guard) ♪
On the highway to BELL(guard) ♪
Highway to BELL(guard) ♪
%
For a detective, you sure do return to
the scene of the crime a lot. 
%
How did Clarice Seeker decide her eldest daughter's name?
She wanted to raise a girl who could take no L's. 
%
Am I the only who thinks the name 'Bellguard'
is just a little on the nose?
%
Getting over barriers wasn't enough, so you had
to go and start breaking boundaries, too? 
%
Barrier? I hardly know her!
%
Crossbell is so advanced that even this chest is
connected to the orbal network. Can you believe it?
%
I wish I were a safe.
%
Cross my bell and hope to die
With a tonfa, give me a black eye
Wait a moment; I spoke a lie--seriously, don't hit me. HEY!
%
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the chest.
%
The orbal net is for Pom Pom Party.
%
Tell me, in great detail, just where exactly you're going
to fit all of that sepith.
%
You've played this game twice and still don't
understand that open means empty?
%
Where does that ladder upstairs lead, you ask?
I...actually don't know, either. I wish I knew.
%
How nice of you to play again!
...You DID use your own file, didn't you?
%
While you're here, don't forget to like,
comment, and chestscribe.
%
If you get any more handsy, I'm going to
have to do your job for you and take you
in myself!
%
The chest reaches into your pocket
and retrieves the item.
%
Ahh! I can finally breathe, now that I don't
have that deviated septium anymore.
%
I actually have an even better treasure in me. The two
who sold it to me said it was invisible to incompetent
people, and clearly they were telling the truth.
%
You just gave me indichestion.
%
I'm glad you came to see me again, but
I really need some 'me' time right now.
%
Aidios will remember that.
%
In the end, maybe the real Zero was
the friends we made along the way.
...Wait. 
%
Sorry, I'll need to ask you to take a seat and wait
for now. I'm very busy, so I'll be with you shortly.
I am the Chest Executive Officer, after all.
%
What do you say when your divine wolf sneezes?
...Goodhoundzeit!
%
I hear the Strega Corporation made a job offer
to Noel. Please look forward to the latest in
Zemurian footwear: Noel Sneakers.
%
I haven't been opened in 500 years...
I can finally move on to the next life. Thank you...
%
You came back! You actually came back for me!
%
In loving memory of Daniel Scott Tijerina,
our fallen hero who exemplified the
indomitable spirit of Crossbell.
%
You know what they say:
...
I wouldn't know, though. I spend all my time here.
%
Upon further inspection, you found a Zeram Capsule.
...Pfft. You wish.
%
Legends say that if you kill 777 Shining Poms
and come back here...you will find this chest
is still empty. 
%
Inside, you find a shirt that reads 'I checked this chest
twice and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.' You decide to
not take it with you.
%
Uh... Ugh...
(That item was for Chestlene's schoolin'...)
%
We chestfolk are actually in the middle of a war.
I can't give you more items because I'm rationing.
Good luck with your quest, though.
%
I should really think about getting a roof installed.
%
H-How did you see me?
%
My parents warned me that bad chests go
to Gehenna where they can never speak.
%
Perhaps one day, scholars will finally be able
to answer the question:
Randy or Lando?
%
As you look in the chest, a bright light goes off.
'AHA! I've got photographic proof! I'm taking this
straight to the Crossbell News Service!'
...You quickly close the lid and leave.
%
Hah! Looking for more? You'll never be able to
crack my secret compartment! ...Especially since
I can't even figure out how to open the thing.
%
Use it well, comrade in rods.
%
Please take our chest satisfaction survey.
%
You need the 'More Chest Messages' DLC
to view this message.
%
Seeing the stark emptiness of the chest, you rethink
your actions. You don't end up putting the item back,
but it's the thought that counts, right?
%
Ironic that in a game starring police detectives
that uphold the law, there are players like you
who just want to break all the rules.
%
Inside the chest you find a smaller chest. Inside
that chest is an even smaller chest. Inside that
is another even smaller chest. Inside that chest...
%
Inside the chest, you find...the truth!
Wow, no wonder it was so hard to reach!
%
If a cluttered chest is a sign of a cluttered
mind, then what's an empty chest a sign of?
A no-good thief!
%
You find a Mishy plush inside of the chest.
A lone tear rolls down its cheek as it is
disappointed in you for breaking the game.
%
I'm not actually a chestfolk, I'm a mimic. I ate the
last group of people who tried to loot me, though,
so I'm full right now. You can go.
%
You don't have to go back to the SSS
building but you can't stay here.
%
You check the chest to see it full of fan mail
addressed to the SSS. It's sweet, but you
wonder how it got there.
%
You may have met my brethren. Between
you and me...they're a little unhinged. 
%
You look, but there are no small children in THIS trunk.
%
With the item you took still in your hand,
you look at the chest. It looks back at you
with an expression that says '...Bruh.'
%
You feel a sharp gaze stare at you from inside the void.
Whose eyes are those?
%
This chest is as empty as your soul!
Chestkind ill needs a looter such as you!
%
It's better to have had treasure and been looted
than to have never had treasure at all.
%
I hope that hotpot teaches you a lesson about
taking what isn't yours.
%
This chest is important foreshadowing.
You just don't know it yet.
%
Huh...? Uh, you want a chest message...?
Um, just a sec... In the middle of a Pom Party
match right now...
%
Chests can't be arrested, you know.
%
First the Bracer Guild, then the CPD...
Now the CGF is helping rob chests, too?!
%
Bad news, pal. You're looking at the baddest
jaeger in all of chestern Zemuria.
%
Rude. 
%
Hey! You're stickin' your Gnosis in places they don't belong.
%
New from Revache: Marconi and cheese!
%
In Crossbell...first you get the sepith,
then you get the mira,
then you get the women.
%
Presenting an all-new menu item: the Special Support Set!
Comes with Pork Tenderlloyds, Elie Mac'N'cheese,
and Randy's Roasted Brocc-Orlando, all on a Tio Plate!
And for dessert? Get over a slice of Bluebarrier Pie!
%
Annie's not okay. She wants you to
Arrest the Smooth Criminal.
%
You find a small pile of chest messages that were
deemed unsuitable for a commercial release.
%
Do you have a warrant, officer?
%
Revache stole that item from someone.
Please return it to its original owner.
%
Just when I thought I was out...they loot me again.
%
Hey! No Lloydering.
%
In the chest is a Get Out of Jail Free card!
You place the chest under arrest.
The charge: facilitating a jailbreak.
%
You murderer! Those monsters were lawful
tenants who paid rent!
%
Upon searching the chest a second time, you discover
the hoops that had to be jumped through in order to
implement these messages.
%
Which idiot named it 'insomnia' and
not 'resisting a rest'? 
%
I swear I was just holding it for a friend.
%
I have a sinking feeling in my chest.
%
The surgery to remove the foreign object was
successful. The chest just needs to be closed
up and allowed a full recovery. Good job.
%
*cough* *cough*...*COUGH* *cough*
Sorry about that. I'm feeling a bit conchested.
%
I've heard if you interact with this chest 100 times while syncing
your button presses perfectly to the BGM and having your entire party's
levels be prime numbers, you'll unlock Arios as a permanent party member...
%
I am the renowned chest specialist, Dr. Trey Shure, PhD.
Thank you for saving me from those hooligans. 
%
Gazing at the chest, you offer a moment of silence.
%
The amount of things in this chest now equals
the game's title. Thanks a lot for that.
%
Not even the Aureole can match your
obsession with empty space.
%
Hey, now that you're in the final stretch, you don't
need to hoard all your rare consumables anymore.
...Right?
%
Abandon all hope, ye who open me.
%
Mafia, assassins, corrupt politicians, and
a drug-dealing cult. Hell of a day, eh?
%
Is that:
All Element Sepith x200
in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
%
An unassuming-looking, middle-aged scholar
who turns out to be evil? In MY Trails game?!
...It's more likely than you think.
%
I AM WATCHING YOU.
%
You know, I bet you can resolve this whole
thing peacefully if you challenge the good
doctor to a fishing duel.
%
If you grind your teeth in an RPG,
do they get stronger?
%
Every time you take something that's not yours
from a chest, Aidios punches a baby pom.
%
If you think about it, a chest is just a
barrier between you and what's inside.
And since when have you let those stop you?
%
I came here from Liberl to hide from a
bracer couple that kept looting my fri--
YOU TWO!
%
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE MY SIGHT.
%
To the guy who invented zero:
Thanks for nothing!
%
Lloyd and friends can get over barriers, but they sure
can't get over stealing from treasure chests.
%
If I were a trader, how much would my Hay be Worth?
Do you think I could Renne a business off of it?
%
Apparently, Arios has been thinking of challenging
Cassius Bright to a duel. If you ask me, he should
just stay in his MacLaine.
%
Detective Bannings...
TEAR! DOWN! THIS! BARRIER!
%
You know there's no achievement for
reading all of these, right?
%
Just how badly do you have to screw up cooking a
Sincere Lunchbox for it to become a Prank Box, anyway?
%
As you peer inside, you're assaulted by an unholy cacophony of
voices, shrilly shouting at you. Making demands, repeating your
failures, questioning your worth.
Knowing you've only ever given your best effort, you ignore them.
%
Sure, Randy's a great guy, but...
Do you ever wonder what happened to
Ranay, Ranby, and Rancy?
%
How do I deal with having my treasures stolen?
Stiff upper lid, my boy. Stiff upper lid.
%
Someone stored Gnosis inside me and
next thing I knew, I was in this cell.
%
I AM COMING FOR YOU.
%
Inside the chest, you find something greater than Aidios and worse
than Gehenna! Something the poor have and the rich need!
Don't try eating it, though.
%
The chest has been stricken with the 'Curse of Kiseki.'
Sadly, nothing else will come out of it for years.
%
I'm a well-known gambler among chestfolk.
You can call me Gambler Jack-in-the-Box.
%
It was the chest of times, it was the worst of times...
%
I expected nothing, and I'm still disappointed.
%
Chest contains nothing,
but you can't carry any more, so you left it there.
%
You discover all of Anton's old love letters.
After reading one, you can't bring yourself
to read the others.
%
I did my job as a chest. Now you do yours.
%
Give it back.
Give it back. Give it back. Give it back. Give it back.
GiveitbackgiveitbackgiveitbackgiveitbackGIVEITBACKGIVEITBACKGIVEITBACK
%
How can Estelle spin her staff so fast?
Because it's a hurry-cane!
%
The chest asks if you will take it with you.
It wants to see the world, particularly Calvard.
Sadly, chests don't make good pets.
%
I HAVE FOUND YOU.
TURN AROUND.
%
This is what I get for opening myself up to others.
%
As you gaze at the empty chest, you convince yourself
that your friends are the only treasure you'll ever need.
%
You're going to love the sequel.
It's called Trails to One.
%
Okay, so you opened me and took my item, but, like...
What do I do now?
%
Hello, darkness, my old friend...
I've come to be looted again...
%
You grimace in horror at the anatomically
correct treasure chest.
%
If you're looking for self-help books, there's one
I recommend called 'Getting Over Barriers.'
It's located in the special support section.
%
Just as this chest is hidden in a horrid place, so too
is treasure hidden in each person, no matter how
horrid they seem on the outside.
%
In overcoming the barriers that lie before you, may you
serve as a guide, that others may overcome their own.
%
You've been demanding it, so here it is.
The long-awaited sequel: Trails in the Chest, Pt. II!
...What do you mean the game's almost over?
%
If this was your first playthrough and you were
expecting to get the treasure chest achievement
just now...yeah. That's only possible in NG+. Sorry. 
%
Welcome to the Geofront. I promise this dungeon
won't take as long as the other Geofront.
%
What? You thought that because it's a fan translation,
all you would find is 'The chest is empty'?
%
The Geofront team developed PTSD arguing
whether to name it the CPD or the CSPD.
%
Signs and equipment were left down here so that
this place would be perfectly serviceable.
%
Why do they call it the GeoFRONT if it's under the city?
...Thank you. I'll be here all game.
%
Phase 1: Collect Tear Balm
Phase 2: ???
Phase 3: Profit
%
You'll take a lost child with you, but not me.
I see how it is.
%
Battle Scopes are one way you can scan enemies for the
Combat Notebook. You should probably get on that, Detective.
%
Luck skill checked...
Luck skill check failed.
The chest is still empty.
%
You find fingerprints inside the chest that point to
the likely culprit. Three guesses as to who that is.
%
You are sucked into the chest. A teacher forces
you to write 'I will not steal from treasure chests'
100 times on a chalkboard before you can leave.
%
But FIRST, a word from our sponsors: Orbal VPN!
%
The higher elements appear to be active in this chest...
Unfortunately, there are still no more items.
%
Support Section off in this oh ♪

Wait, you don't live in Villa-Raisins.
Get outta here!
Chapter 3: Please close my lid. Can't you see how much
confetti I'm collecting?
%
Zzz... Zzz...
(The chest appears to be drooling in its sleep.)
%
No wonder no one trusts the police these days.
They're out here stealing from us treasure chests!
Chapter 3: Happy birthday, Crossbell! It's Usher! *Xbox 360 sound*
%
...What? I'm not on the clock, so screw off.
They don't pay me enough to make witty
remarks to players using debug.
%
Did you know? The Bell of Crossbell was recovered in S1185, but it was
known of long before researchers relocated it. Its documented history
dates back to the Middle Ages, and it helped inspire the name 'Crossbell'.
Chapter 3: Is celebrating the Anniversary Festival underneath
the Bell of Crossbell weird or the most appropriate
way to celebrate Crossbell imaginable?
%
Let's play hide-and-seek. You hide
something valuable in me, and then
go seek therapy for kleptomania.
%
The chest joins your party! It will wait here.
%
'Nyeh nyeh nyeh!'
(Imelda appears to have left a voice recorder in the chest.)
%
I wonder how the Grand Chardonnay
I used to have ended up.
%
You check the chest and find this text box.
It is a very good text box, I assure you.
Very well written.
%
Kept you waiting, huh?
Chapter 3: I tried to go join the festivities, too, but...
I kind of got lost in the B Sector.
%
How'd you even get here? Don't you
have anything better to do?
%
The last thing I want to do is hurt you...
but it's still on the list.
%
I've spent my entire life on top of Revache's factory
and this is STILL the worst crime I've ever witnessed.
%
You didn't earn that and you know it.
%
A treasure chest walked into a bar.
Obviously it was a mimic and immediately slaughtered.
Poor thing didn't even get a drink...
%
You can't even DO the quest that's useful for yet.
Baby... What is you doin'?
%
The real Tio would be disappointed in you.
%
So ya finally figured out how
to get to me, did ya?
%
Damn tourists always wandering into places they
don't belong... Wait, how ARE you here right now?
%
If I catch you using debug again,
I'm gonna whoop your de-butt. 
%
AHHH! Goddess, it hurts! The grass
is clipping right through me!
%
Welcome to the Crossbell Watchtower.
...We don't know what it's for, either.
%
I thought you were supposed to serve the people!
%
The contents of this chest brought to you
by the International Bank of Crossbell.
Visit us for premium sepith exchange rates.
%
It's empty, but the woodwork is amazing!
Is it...chestnut?
%
Can you feel how hard this chest is?
I could bench press your entire party.
%
Sorry. No returns, exchanges, or chest credit.

Hi, I'm Chest McClure. You may remember me
from such Falcom games as...
%
My buddy's from Liberl and he got his
message written by a professional.
%
Yeah, well, my cousin's Erebonian and
he didn't even GET a message!
%
You are now breathing manually.
That's my revenge for taking that quartz. 
%
Next time, I'm using a lock.
%
Is the chest half-full or half-empty?
Neither. It's completely empty.
%
I always wanted to be a fisherman
but, well... *sob*
%
Don't call me a box! I'm not a box!
My cousin's a box and he's a complete idiot!
%
The chest is empty and exercises its right to remain silent.
%
A bracer assaulting a chest, I can understand.
But a cop? That's low, man.
%
If my wish come true, I want to become a bird.
Even if I lose everything else, someday I want
to go to the place of memories with him.
%
What is Zemuria's favorite brand of popcorn?
Orbal Redenbacher.
%
I hope your pockets are now Lloyded with sepith.
%
I'd put a joke about law enforcement here,
but it'd be a bit of a cop-out.
%
After that string of chest thefts in Liberl, you
would think they'd have some locks installed.
%
There are some...peculiar magazines inside the
chest. You decide to leave them where they are,
despite Randy's protests...
%
Back in my day, we had to work HARD for our
curia balms. And we definitely wouldn't have 99
of them on our second playthrough. No, siree. 
%
You're really going to take that EP Cut 1?
Haven't the Armoricans been through enough? 
%
If the CPD found out who stole from me,
you'd be unempLloyd.
%
As you walk away with a mediocre item, you fail to notice
that the chest itself is made of priceless Zemurian Ore.
%
Did it just get a lot Brighter out here?
%
Thanks, actually. I needed to get that
off my chest.
%
This tree didn't IMPEDE you from seeing me.
%
Amongst chests, it's not what's on the inside
that counts, but what's on the outside.
%
If that's Stargazer's Tower, does this
make me Towergazer's Chest?
%
If you're 'down' with the 'sickness,' then
maybe you should get yourself checked-in
to St. Ursula Medical College.
%
Haven't you checked your workout schedule?
Today's leg day, not chest day!
%
In a flash of entrepeneurial inspiration, you decide
to pin a notice to the chest:
'For rent. Newly renovated interior. 200 mira/month.'
%
Oh, great. I'm going to stay like this forever, aren't I?
%
How about you do your job and actually arrest someone
for once? Yourselves, in this case. 
%

You find a notebook with a gauntlet on it. You
decide to leave it in case the owner comes back.
%
I used to be an adventurer like you.
Then I took an arrow to the keyhole.
%
It is unbecoming for a law enforcer to be this greedy.
You lose 15 DP.
%
Chest messaging rates may apply.
%
Inside the chest, you discover the secret city of Chestbell.
%
I guess you could say the contents of this
chest add up to...zero.
%
Police brutality!
%
Help! I'm careening off of a cliff!
I think my S-Brakes were cut!
%
I had hoped that Phantom Thief B would be the one to
loot me. I guess I'm not beautiful enough. *whimper*
%
Your investigation into the theft of this chest comes
up empty, much like the chest itself. You conveniently
ignore the fact that you are the thief.
%
For your use of debug mode, your IP address has been logged.
You will be blocked from downloading Trails to ZX Advent. 
%
Ah HA! I'm actually an undercover chest
working for the Chest Police Department.
You're busted, buster!
%
This is where I would put my item...
IF I HAD ONE!
%
The real treasure is buried underneath, but
you'll never be able to move me! NEVER!
%
Keep up the good work, and you're bound to be
a Mainz-stay around here.
%
Did you hear about the woman who had a craving for goldia sepith?
She just wanted some space, man.
%
I'm not empty. I'm making a statement.
%
Mine your own business.
%
Your request for a rare, ultra powered quartz from
before the Septian Calendar is being processed.
Please stand by.
%
I'll let you in on a little secret. There was more than
one item in here, but someone beat you to it and
took the good stuff. The bad stuff? You're holding it.
%
Remember when you didn't have to check the
treasure chests twice? Ah, those were the days.
%
Just think. If you spent less time harassing chests, you
could have already finished this support request.
%
You peer deep inside the chest once again,
only to bump your head against the lid as
you stand back up. Serves you right. 
%
Made you look.
%
A note inside of the treasure chest reads:
'I already have 99, so you guys take this one.
- Estelle'
%
Don't worry. I'll restock in time for New Game Plus.
%
Can you close my lid? I don't want a bird to
build a nest inside me or something.
%
You're from the city? Do you know my pal, Lyd?
He comes by all the time to watch the trains.
%
Does the phrase 'unlawful search and seizure'
ring any bells for you?
%
Someone should EP Charge you with theft.
%
Mya~uun.
Nya~on.
%
Ahh, I get it. Fish prints.
Of course. Fish prints.
%
The true result of the Non-Aggression Pact is not
technological exchange, but the spread of talkative
treasure chests that previously were only in Liberl.
%
Disappointed with the chest's contents, you close it.
One could call this...an open-and-shut case.

How did Clarice Seeker decide her eldest daughter's name?
She wanted to raise a girl who could take no L's. 
%
Am I the only who thinks the name 'Bellguard'
is just a little on the nose?
%
Getting over barriers wasn't enough, so you had
to go and start breaking boundaries, too? 
%
Barrier? I hardly know her!
%
Crossbell is so advanced that even this chest is
connected to the orbal network. Can you believe it?
%
I wish I were a safe.
%
Had it not been for the laws of this autonomous state,
I would have slaughtered you.
%
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the chest.
%
Somewhere out there, someone is asking
Rixia to show bobs on the orbal net.
%
Tell me very specifically where you're going
to fit all of that sepith.
%
You've played this game twice and still don't
understand that open means empty?
%
Where does that ladder upstairs lead, you ask?
I...actually don't know, either. I wish I knew.
%
How nice of you to play again!
...You DID use your own file, didn't you?
%
While you're here, don't forget to like,
comment, and chestscribe.
%
If you get any more handsy, I'm going to
have to do your job for you and take you
in myself!
%
The chest reaches into your pocket
and retrieves the item.
%
Dieter chuckled. 'You mean the Chaos Septium?'
%
I'M ESKIMO. THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
%
You just gave me indichestion.
%
I'm glad you came to see me again, but
I really need some 'me' time right now.
%
Aidios will remember that.
%
Maybe the real Geofront was the
friends we made along the way.

Please take a seat and wait your turn.
I'm a very busy chest.
I am the Chest Executive Officer, after all.

%
Legends say that if you kill 777 Shining Poms

I should really think about getting a roof installed.

H-How did you see me?
%
Inside, you find a shirt that reads 'I checked this chest
twice and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.' You decide to
not take it with you.
%
You brute! I can't believe you took my chestity like that!
You had better take responsibility!
%
We chest people are actually in the middle of a war.
I can't give you more items because I'm rationing.
Good luck with your quest, though.
%
Meh. The NEC PC-8801 version of this chest

Did you know that Tria, the receptionist at the Crossbell
News Service, has a red pyramid on her desk?

Listen, I'm not that kind of chest. I was drunk

it was you.
%
Use it well, comrade in rods.
%
Please take our chest satisfaction survey.
%
You need the 'More Chest Messages' DLC
to view this message.
%
They say that to err is human. Indeed,
by your hands, I am now naught but air.
%
Ironic that in a game starring police detectives
that uphold the law, there are players like you
who just want to break all the rules.
%
Inside the chest you find a smaller chest. Inside
that chest is an even smaller chest. Inside that
is another even smaller chest. Inside that chest...
%
It's bad enough I'm wasting a week inserting all
of these chest messages. On top of it, I have to
write unique ones for cheating jerks like you.
%
If a cluttered chest is a sign of a cluttered
mind, then what's an empty chest a sign of?
A no-good thief!
%
You find a Mishy plush inside of the chest.
A lone tear rolls down its cheek as it is
disappointed in you for breaking the game.
%
You open the chest and peer downward, only
to find a clay hand making a certain gesture.
Got 'em.
%
You don't have to go back to the SSS
building but you can't stay here.
%
You check the chest to see it full of fan mail
addressed to the SSS. It's sweet, but you
wonder how it got there.
%
You may have met my brethren. Between
you and me...they're a little unhinged. 
%
You look, but there are no small children in THIS trunk.
%
My parents warned me that bad chests go
to Gehenna where they can never speak.
%
You feel a sharp gaze stare at you from inside the void.
Whose eyes are those eyes?
%
This chest is as empty as your soul!
Chestkind ill needs a looter such as you!
%
It's better to have been looted and lost than
to have never been looted at all.
%
Randy met his match at the casino. A girl in a frilly
white dress had a good hand and went all-Renne.
%
This chest is important foreshadowing.
You just don't know it yet.

I'd have a witty message, but our lead
editor was too busy playing FFXIV.

Chests can't be arrested, you know.

First the Bracer Guild, then the CPD...

Just when I thought I was out...they loot me again.

%
The surgery to remove the foreign object was
successful. The chest just needs to be closed
up and allowed a full recovery. Good job.
%
*cough* *cough*...*COUGH* *cough*
Sorry about that. I'm feeling a bit conchested.
%
After reexamining the chest, you find something else...
IT'S THE BUG OF LEGENDS!
%
Maybe she's born with it.
Maybe it's Ursuline. 
%
Rest in peace, Unsho Ishizuka. Though you may
be gone, your voice lives on through Sergei Lou

The amount of things in this chest now equals

Mafia, assassins, corrupt politicians, and

Every time you open a chest, Aidios
sheds a tear. Think about it.

Not like that's stopping you!

Someone stored Gnosis inside me and

Chief Roberts has been pulling strings to have
Crossbell rename the Geofront the 'Tiofront'.
Would the dev team have to change their name, too?

The chest has been stricken with the
'Curse of Kiseki'. Sadly, nothing else

I'm a well-known gambler among chest folk.

I expected nothing, and I'm still disappointed.

Found nothing.
Can't hold any more, so left it behind.

How can Estelle spin her staff so fast?
Because it's a hurry-cane!

The chest asks if you will take it with you.
It wants to see the world, particularly Calvard.
Sadly, chests don't make good pets.
%
You can argue over who best boy is, but I think
we can all agree that Zeit is goodest boy.
%
This is what I get for opening myself up to others.
%
As you gaze at the empty chest, you convince yourself
that your friends are the only treasure you'll ever need.
%
You're going to love the sequel.
It's called Trails to ZX Advent.
%
So this is what an existential crisis feels like...
%
Hello, darkness, my old friend...
I've come to be looted again...
%
You grimace in horror at the anatomically
correct treasure chest.
%
If you're looking for self-help books, there's one
I recommend called 'Getting Over Barriers'.
It's located in the special support section.
%
Just as this chest is hidden in a horrid place, so
is treasure hidden in each person, no matter how
horrid they seem on the outside.
%
Give a man a ladder and he'll climb a wall.
Give a man companions and he'll protect a city.
%
You've been demanding it, so here it is.
The long-awaited sequel: Trails in the Chest 2!
...What do you mean the game's almost over?
%
If this was your first playthrough and you were
expecting to get the treasure chest achievement
just now...yeah. That's only possible in NG+. Sorry. 
%
Why would a talking chest like me choose to live in
a place like this? You'd be surprised how badly D∴G
tanked the property values here. Rent is dirt cheap!
%
Would you like to join our order, O∴E?
We teach that if a chest is open, it is
therefore empty.

When choosing whether to stick with the old font or
use a new one, there was a fair amount of arguments
over it, but we eventually reached a Cuprumise.

Would you like to join our order, O∴E?
We teach that if a chest is open, it is

%
For marketing purposes, we named the game Trails to Azure.
Internally, we still call it Trails to ZX Advent.
%
You may have heard that Calvard has lax immigration policies.
It's true! Most of my fellow Altair chests had parents and
grandparents that came from Liberl and Crossbell.
%
I've been here since the raid and I really want a change of scenery.
Think I might apply for a job at the Locksmith Agency.

Look at my chest! What do you see? ♪

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but

Lloyd had to ground KeA for the first time over
the summer. He told her to pick up after herself

If this ain't a chest message,
then I don't know what is.

Did you know if you join the Business Owners'
Association and start hiding items inside of chests,
they double over time? It's called Mors' law.
%
Why do Puck and Roose hate Zhang Hui's lectures?
Because they're Long and Laod.

Someone has to end this cycle of looting.
What do you say, ready to bury the latchet?
This is so sad. Enigma II tactical orbment,

%
The treasure chest activates its power to stop time!
Fortunately, it can't do anything, either, so nothing
happens while you read this text.
%
Wow, a sequel to Trails in the Chest?
I can't believe the Geofront got a
chest-selling author to work on Azure.

An advertisement is pasted to the bottom side of the lid:

You may be asking what happened to the SSS's
leftover sepith in Trails from Zero. What, you think
you can put KeA through college on a CPD salary?

Silly Falcom. Fans said they wanted
chest messages, not chest massages.

You know, maybe the real treasure was the treasure inside of me all along.
Seriously. Give it back.

Plankly, I don't see what you find so funny about puns.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand police-
stealing-from-treasure-chest jokes. The humor is extremely subtle,
and without a solid grasp of Crossbell State law, most of the jokes
will go over a typical player's head.
%
I have a cousin back in Liberl. Just sent me a letter complaining
that some famous chest-robbers are on the loose again, and
they even have a new member in their ranks!
%
Is there anything better than treasure?
Arguably, a really good book. I'd recommend
the Sunshine Agnes series, personally.

Any reference to that other big Falcom
series would be a great Yster Egg.
%
Did you know chests are natural-born boxers?
It's no surprise, really. We're always squared up.
%
This chest has a content respawn rate of zero percent.
%
You rummage around and see dozens of rejected chest messages
where 'azure' was used as a pun on 'assure.'
%
You know you're a Kiseki fan when you're watching sports
and you hear '...trails at the half' very differently.
%
That item's used. As in, it used to be
mine before you took it.

Thank you, Pockle.

I always dreamed of being plundered by the pirate Schirmer.

'Why do they call the Enigma II an ORBment?
The quartz are square. The frame is square.
They should call it a SQUAREment.'
'That's goldia, Jerry! Goldia!'

Upon closer inspection, you notice this chest is made of Grimwood.
Don't panic, but you've just robbed the relative of a lawyer.
%
You admire the chest's curves and luscious locks.
%
If this place has been deserted since before the Orbal Revolution,
how did I have a quartz inside me? Chew on that one...
%
What's the difference between an RPG protagonist and a rare
metal collector? One treasures your steel, and the other steals

Story of my life: I was placed here, I had

Upon closer inspection, you see a chess board in the chest.

Wow, thank you so much for playing the game twice!
I guess you could say Azure doesn't lose its...luster.

A message is engraved in the chest: 'Hngh... Lechter.

dummy thicc, and the sound of my blood-and-iron
rule keeps alerting the mayor.'

Aaaaah! Yeah, clip that grass into me.

I still haven't been told what this tower
is for, so as far as I'm concerned...
Welcome to the Crossbell Chest Tower.
%
I'd love to Cast 1, too, but the
fishing spot is way over there!
%
Scratched into the bottom of the chest is a heart containing 'Anton +.'
The name on the right side has been written over too many times to read.
%
Crimson & Co. is starting its own line of oil paints.
Its flagship pigment is 'The Red Ocher.'
%
If only all Trails fans would stock up on Battle Scopes.
Then they could finally stop arguing about power levels.
%
Does everyone consent to this looting?
The SSS and chest: 'I do.'
Aidios: 'I don't.'
%
I swear officer, I don't know HOW that got in there!
Someone framed me, and they used mahogany to do it!
%
Don't you DARE think about oiling my hinges.
Can't you see I'm the Squeaker of the Chestbell Diet? 
%
Holy crap!
Is that a motherhecking
GAGHARV reference??? 
%
Did you hear about the time Phantom Thief B broke into Arc en Ciel?
I'm told he stole the spotlight.
%
Great. Right after I finally got new
stock from Mr. Hayworth, too.
%
Seventy years ago this week, us Crossbell
chests were finally freed of Imperial rule.
Welcome to our Anniversary Chestival.

Download the Chestvolution voice mod so that
every chest message in the game will be voiced.

Don't forget that you can return the SSS's car to the garage
remotely. Just open the state map and press !
%
Now I'm one step closer to mastering
the Eight Leaves' Seventh Form: Void. 
%
You pick up an invitation for a fighting game but
put it down so you can focus on support requests.
%
The Zemurian metric system has a few obscure
measurements that don't get talked about often.
For example, salt is measured in Grahams.
%
A hand holding an orbal gun
peeks out from inside the chest.
'The Elder King sends his regards.'
%
A bracer, an Erebonian, and a member of the CPD walk into a bar.
Shortly thereafter, they'rsic each admitted to St. Ursula with mild
concussions.
%
I was once Towergazer's Chest, but the new diet and mayor had
me renovated. Now I'm an upscale apartment for monster swarms.

Attached to the balm is a label that reads 'Best before: S1005.'
Perhaps you shouldn't use this one...
%
Please, take me to St. Ursula Hospital!
All that fighting left me with chest pains...
%
Stupid cryptid... You never would have
looted me had it not blown my hiding spot! 
%
Why am I not surprised that Neue Blanc's
most-ordered drinks are Bloody Shirlies
and Jaegermeisters?
%
I just wrote a script about the dictionary for the next Arc en Ciel production.
It's a play on words.
%
This is the Geofront hidden below Tokyo-3.
NERV's protection from the angels' assault.
Oh, wait a minute. Wrong franchise. Silly me.
%
Randy was first in line to buy the Epstein Foundation's first ever orbal pager.
He's calling it the Red Beeper. 
%
Dunno much about the orbal net, but cloud storage sounds like heresy.
Chestkind should not infringe upon the domain of Chestios,
She Who Stores Above...

The truth of the Zemurian continent is that Aidios--

do you think Chestbell can hold out?
%
Hello, lads! I'm President Locksmith, and it's a pleasure
to meet you. I'd like to award you medals for opening all
of my friends earlier this year during the bolt incident.
%
I guess chests weren't important enough to invite to the
trade conference, huh, Dieter? Fine. We'll be holding our
own Chest Zemuria Trade Conference.
%
How often do you think Remiferian general
goods stores get phone calls asking if they
have Prince Albert in a can?
%
Day 394: It was another cold Tuesday
morning when suddenly I realized...
I was still a treasure chest.
%
I'm really glad Princess Klaudia got to
speak with Lechter again. Maybe now
she can finally have some Klosure.
%
'Tis I, the Box of Iron Chancellor. How long
do you think Chestbell can hold out?

The chest is empty...and this napalm!

This chest message is exclusive to the Evolution version
and will have to be downloaded separately.
%
Erebonia to the left of me, Calvard to the right.
Here I am, stuck in the middle with loot.
%
Found Chest Message. 
%
Which one do you think is a bigger mess?
Crossbell's political climate or Ilya's room?
%
Congratulations on beating Chst IX: Monstrum Knox.
%
If a chest is looted in the forest, does it make a sound?
%
Hahahaha... Chestaldinho Boxxer! 
%
That wasn't very cash mira of you.
%
You open the chest. Inside is a tiny Pom.
It would wave, but it has no arms.
%
If monsters like to eat sepith and I was full
of sepith...does that make me a...? Oh, no...
%
Fun fact: The retry option in Sully's quest? Completely
unique to Geofront Azure. Don't know what I'm talking
about? You either nailed it or really messed up today.
%
Inside the treasure chest was absolutely nothing.
Nothing after nothing came bursting out.
%
I used to be a normal chest and then some blue-haired,
labcoat-wearing jerk stored red pills inside me.
%
The chest you have opened is not in service.
Please leave a message after the *clack*.
%
*click* Yep. This one's going in my hinge compilation.
%
If Trails to Azure is so good, where is Trails to Bzure?
%
Please, save us from these treasure chest messages.
We're ALSO out of ideas...

Lloyd's Brave Smash is just the bump system on fire!
Change my mind!
%
There was a fishing hole here. It's gone now.
%
The chest tries to swallow you whole,
but doesn't find you very dichestible.
%
One day, it is prophesied that the true treasure chest
will lead all chests in the fight against the adventurers.
This day will be called: Ragnabox! Come, the Aboxalypse!
%
You killed my only friends, so tell me...
Who's the REAL monster here?
%
We tried getting the Randy pepperoni pizza
mod to work in Zero, but it kept making the
game run at four-cheese frames per second.
%
I wanted to be a music box,
but I couldn't carry a tune.
%
It would have been a crime not to open me.
What charge, you ask? Resisting a-chest.
%
Chest fact: Chests have domed lids to discourage being
sat on and repel water from pooling atop it. Doing so
extends the lifespan of the chest!
%
Thought you could get more, did you?
Sorry, pal--no duplicates. Chest la vie. 
%
I read all about the raid in the Chestbell Times.
...What? I like to keep achest of the news.
%
Inside is a Mishy plush that Randy accidentally
gave to Zeit as a chew toy. He quickly shuts the
lid before Tio can see it.
%
Reading this message adds 5 bonding points to one of the characters,
but we're not going to tell you which one!
%
You open the chest, finding a scrap of paper
with some writing on it: 'This pun is tearable.'
You groan as you close the lid.
%
I was under the impression that this was the Geofront C-hest Sector.
I believe there's been some kind of mistake.
%
Do you have a particular 'chest' voice you read all of these in?
%
You find a bag of round breath fresheners in the chest.
They're labeled, 'Epstein Orb Mints: Leman Flavor.'
The chest is empty.
%
Received the chest's Pom! Pom! Party! account info. 
%
Where do treasure chests come from?
Well, when a carpenter and pile of lumber
love each other very much...
%
Things are going in some interesting directions, eh?
No wonder they call him Detour Crois.
%
ZCF and Mishelam Wonderland collaborated to invent
new playground equipment. But after months of work,
all they came up with was a swing and a Mish.

Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the chestiest of them all?
%
Arc en Ciel tried to recruit me as a stage prop,
but I hate being boxed into only one kind of role.
%
Are you back because you thought I was booty-full?
Congratulations! After a game and a half of being a police
detective, you finally managed to find the real Criminal.
I guess you can stop playing now.

I was sentenced 25 to life for chestslaughter.

Congrats to Lloyd for changing Noel Seeker

Before opening Trinity, Wazy's first cover job idea was

It's not too late in the game for Randy

Ouroboros as Enforcer No. LXIX.

They're Tear-Alls because they're made from the tears

The truth of the Zemurian continent is that Aidios--

Congregation for the Sacraments].
%
I've always been bothered by my pointed features,
but people tell me I'd make for a good model.
They say I have all the right angles. 
%
Every chest you open gets Ouroboros one step
closer to obtaining the Sept-Terrion of Chests.
%
You ever stop and think about how the CPD
awarded you 5 DP for breaking out of prison?
%
You find what appears to be a botched attempt
at Fierce Tiger Chao Fan. Elie suddenly seems to
be in a hurry to leave the area.
%
Goddess forbid Crossbell becomes part of the Empire again.
The Imperial government would probably silence all of us
Crossbellan chests for good!

Keep an eye on that Rixia Mao. I have reason
to believe that she is engaged in thespionage.

If you keep checking every chest in this tower,
we're going to start calling your team the

Crossbell City wasn't built in a day. It took

me a favor and end this story in style.

The chest has thrown its lid off. It's no
longer holding back its empty contents.

I applied for a domain on the orbal network,
not to MOVE to a Domain. Stupid Crossbell
bureaucracy mix-ups.

Even if it is the hard way, it's still the right way!
You can do it, SSS!

I guess you could say that you have all the elements
of a hero in the making. Go get 'em.

I kept telling the others it was just water weight.
Maybe now they'll believe me.

Hopefully, that will help you overcome
the last handful of barriers in your way.

I would say I'm a down to earth chest, but now I'm down to nothing.

A closer inspection of the chest reveals an inscription that says 'For Doodles.'
Wow, this really is the inside of KeA's heart.
